## Healthy habits for course completion

Here is a list of best practices that will help you complete the courses in the program in a timely manner:

- **Plan your time:** Setting regular study times and following them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to set achievable goals. Find a space that allows you to focus when you watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities.
    
- **Work at your own pace:** Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, feel free to progress through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. You can extend your deadlines at any time by going to **Overview** in the navigation panel and selecting **Switch Sessions**. If you have already missed previous deadlines, select **Reset my deadlines** instead.
    
- **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The steps you take to support your learning along the way will advance your knowledge, create more opportunities in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs. 
    
- **Take notes:** Notes will help you remember important information in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
    
- **Review exemplars:** Exemplars are completed assignments that fully meet an activity's criteria. Many activities in this program have exemplars for you to compare to your own work. Although there are often many ways to complete an assignment, exemplars offer you guidance and inspiration about how to complete the activity. 
    
- **Chat (responsibly) with other learners:** If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Use the [discussion forums](https://www.coursera.org/learn/get-started-with-python/discussions) to ask for help from other learners taking this program.

# Python versus other programming languages

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, which makes it a great addition to your data analytics toolbox! As we’ve previously investigated, Python’s use of syntax to communicate commands and perform tasks mirrors spoken language. This makes Python a much easier programming language to learn. Python’s structure is similar to many other programming languages, but there are some key differences to consider as well.

In this reading, you’ll learn how Python compares to other programming languages data professionals use, including R, Java, and C++. 

## Five considerations of programming languages

Python isn’t the only programming language used for data analysis, but it is one of the most widely used and most powerful. Many data professionals even use more than one programming language. Every language has benefits and drawbacks. For the purposes of this course, examine the following considerations: speed, approachability, variables, data science focus, and programming paradigm.

### **Speed**

There are many factors that contribute to the speed of a program’s execution, including compile time, runtime, hardware, installed dependencies, and the efficiency of the code itself. In general, low-level programming languages are faster, but they’re more difficult to learn and work with. 

### **Approachability**

Approachability refers to how easy it is for new learners to start using a language. Learning new programming languages can be challenging depending on their syntax and overall structure. The **syntax** is the structure of code words, symbols, placement, and punctuation. Semantics builds meaning into those structures by using variables and objects. Additionally, those variables help add flexibility to the programs and objects where data is housed. 

### **Variables**

Information in code is stored in variables. A **variable** is a named container which stores values in a reserved location in the computer’s memory. The way a programming language uses variables will have an effect on a system's core operations or kernel speed. Some languages use static variables to maintain a value throughout the entire run of a program. Others approach variables as dynamic, allowing values to be determined when a program is run. Some languages even allow declarative variables, which enable a program to determine where a variable should be placed. 

### **Data science focus**

Programming languages have individual characteristics and can better serve different tasks in data analysis; this means programmers often use them for specific data science tasks. 

### **Programming paradigm**

Programming languages can be object-oriented, functional, or imperative. Object-oriented programming languages are modeled around data objects. Functional programming languages are modeled around functions. Imperative languages are modeled around code statements that can alter the state of the program itself. 

## Programming language comparisons

Python, R, Java and C++ are four of the most commonly used programming languages for data analysis. The following chart compares them using five considerations: speed, accessibility, variable, data science focus, and programming paradigm. 

|**Features by Software**|**Python**|**R**|**Java**|**C++**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Speed**|Slower|Depends on configuration and add-ons|Faster|Very fast|
|**Approachability**|Easy to learn|Complex|Easy to learn|Complex|
|**Variable**|Dynamic|Dynamic|Static|Declarative|
|**Data science focus**|Machine learning and automated analysis|Exploratory data analysis and building extensive statistical libraries|Used across projects with open-source assets|Not as widely used but very powerful implementations|
|**Programming Paradigm**|Object-oriented|Functional language|Object-oriented|Multi-paradigm (imperative & object-oriented)|

## Key takeaways

There are a number of different programming languages that can be used for data analysis. Each language has its own benefits and drawbacks. Learning to work with different languages will give you the opportunity to broaden your data skills and access new tools for your analysis. However, in this certificate program, Python will be your sole focus. As mentioned previously, Python is an easy to learn, object-oriented programming language that engages dynamic variables; though it sometimes requires a longer time to execute, it is a great tool for machine learning and automated analysis.# How to use Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, mathematical formulas, visualizations, and text. This is a great tool to develop and present code in a standardized text block format that is interactive and shareable. You can create code, mathematical formulas, data visualizations, and even freestyle text—all in Jupyter notebooks!

You will be using Jupyter notebooks to write, execute, and present your own code throughout this program. This reading will guide you through using your own notebook. Note, however, that for this certificate program you do not need to download any software. You can complete all activities with the tools provided on the Coursera platform.

# Jupyter Notebook

You can access Jupyter Notebook directly from your browser or download the desktop application onto your device to work with over 100 programming languages, including some you might already know like R and Python. There is [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the full suite of tools for working with computational notebooks. There is also [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a more streamlined and simplified tool that nonetheless offers powerful ways to perform interactive computing. Again, for this certificate program, we recommend working within the Jupyter Notebook interface provided by Coursera. Activities that use Jupyter notebooks will be labeled as labs, and you will find relevant instructions for each activity on its landing page.

# Why Jupyter Notebook?

Notebooks are particularly useful for working with data. Here are some ways that Jupyter notebooks excel:

1. **Modular/interactive computing:** You can write and execute individual chunks of code in small, manageable chunks, which are called cells. You can run a cell without necessarily having to run the whole notebook. This is especially helpful for data exploration and experimentation. Cells are also helpful with debugging, because they provide a user-friendly way to make a mistake, notice that you made the mistake, and iterate back to correct your mistake, without having to re-execute a whole script.
    
2. **Integration of code and documentation:** Notebooks allow you to combine code, textual explanations, and visualizations like charts, graphs, and tables—all in a single document. 
    
3. **Support for multiple languages:** The Advanced Data Analytics program will use Python, but Jupyter notebooks support many other languages, making them powerful and versatile.
    
4. **Data exploration and analysis:** The notebook simplifies working with data by offering tools to load, clean, analyze, and examine it in an elegant interface.
    
5. **Cloud-based services:** Many cloud computing platforms host Jupyter notebooks, which makes it easy to run and share notebooks without setting up a local environment. This is very useful for collaboration.
    
6. **Libraries and extensions:** There is a rich ecosystem of extensions and plugins that enhance functionality for whatever type of project you’re working on.

# How to use Jupyter notebooks

Once you’ve opened a Jupyter notebook, it’s time to use it! Here are some tips to get started.

## Command/edit mode

Notebooks have two working modes: command mode and edit mode. Command mode is used to interact with the notebook as a whole and perform actions like adding, moving, and deleting cells. Edit mode is used to type code or markdown text into a particular cell. 

Command mode is indicated by a blue bar on the left side of the current cell.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/8c605b1f-b710-43de-a0de-b64050a63779)

Edit mode is indicated by a green bar on the left and also a thin green border around the active cell.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/7bdf2c52-efb3-4c61-aaf6-f431eb69f944)

To enter into edit mode, simply click into a cell to insert your cursor there or use the navigation arrows on your keyboard to select a cell and press Enter. To revert back to command mode, click anywhere outside the cell or press the escape key.

## Markdown mode

Jupyter notebooks allow you to toggle cells between coding mode and Markdown mode. Markdown is a markup language that lets you add formatting elements to plain text. It’s useful because it’s ubiquitous, future-proof, and platform independent. In Jupyter notebooks, Markdown text is used to provide written explanations, analysis, and context to explain the code and its output. In the following example, all of the text above In [41]: was written and formatted using Markdown.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/00f6815a-fca8-4a6d-b838-038a55f64580)

To toggle between code and Markdown mode, go to the menu at the top of the page and click where it says “Code.” Then, select “Markdown” from the dropdown menu that appears.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/df52ceee-3f35-4214-a032-8f0032e47ea8)

For more information about how to use Markdown, refer to [Markdown guide for basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and the [Markdown guide for extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/).

## Common actions

Most actions can be performed using both a mouse/graphic interface and keyboard shortcuts. Here are some of the most common actions.

### Add a new cell

- Click on Insert in the menu bar at the top of the notebook. Options are to insert a new cell above or below the current cell.
    
- Keyboard shortcuts (while in command mode):
    
    - **a:** Insert a cell above the current cell
        
    - **b:** Insert a cell below the current cell
        

### Delete a cell

- Use command mode to select a cell or group of cells.
    
- Click on Edit in the menu bar at the top of the notebook and select Delete Cells from the dropdown menu.
    
- Keyboard shortcut (while in command mode): 
    
    - **dd** (press D two times)
        

### Move a cell

- Use command mode to select a cell or group of cells.
    
- Click on the up arrow button or down arrow button in the menu bar at the top of the notebook to move the selected cell(s) up or down 
    

### Run a cell

- Select a cell and click the **Run** button in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.
    
- Keyboard shortcuts:
    
    - **Ctrl + Enter:** Run selected cell
        
    - **Shift + Enter:** Run selected cell and select next cell
        
    - **Alt + Enter:** Run selected cell and insert new cell below
        
- You can run cells from both command mode and edit mode
    

Press **h** while in command mode for a pop-up window with all available keyboard shortcuts. You can also check out [Jupyter Notebook interface components](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ui_components.html) for more detailed descriptions of various notebook features.

# Troubleshooting

You will use Jupyter notebooks throughout the Advanced Data Analytics certificate program. At times, you might encounter difficulty accessing or running the notebook. Here are some troubleshooting steps to help you if this happens.

## Browser compatibility

Make sure your internet browser is updated regularly. It is best to use the latest version of Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. If your browser is outdated or you are using a browser that is not supported by Coursera, you may encounter a problem. If your browser is up to date and you are using one of the browsers listed above and still encountering problems, try restarting your browser or clearing your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also use incognito mode, which prevents your browser from storing cookies and other temporary data.

## Internet connection

Coursera requires a stable internet connection. If you are experiencing problems starting or running a Jupyter notebook, your internet connection may be slow or unreliable. Some signs of an unstable internet connection may be pages failing to load, freezing labs, or the inability to type or enter commands within the lab environment. 

**Pro Tip:** If you are unable to complete a lab on one device, try using another device.

## Troubleshooting steps

To summarize, here are the troubleshooting steps to try if you encounter a problem with Jupyter notebooks in Coursera. 

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of a supported browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
    
2. Restart your browser and clear your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also use incognito mode.
    
3. Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable. You can try restarting your router and modem to regain a stable connection.
    
4. Try restarting the lab again.
    

If all this fails, it’s possible that Coursera is performing maintenance or experiencing a service interruption. In that case, wait a little while and try again.

# Key takeaways

Jupyter Notebook provides a coding platform where you can develop and debug your own code. Knowing how to use and interact with notebooks will prepare you for upcoming activities where you will try out new Python skills and prepare for the end-of-course project. Python will be a great tool in your toolkit—it will open up more advanced analytics tools like machine learning and automated analysis. And, using Jupyter Notebook will be a great way to build your Python knowledge!

# More about object-oriented programming

**Note:** This reading contains only a brief introduction to object-oriented programming. A more detailed discussion about the nuances of object oriented programming is beyond the scope of this course.

Previously, we identified object-oriented programming as a programming paradigm that is based around objects, which can contain both data and code that manipulates that data. You may recall that a class is an object’s data type that bundles data and functionality together, and you’ve encountered some examples of this class-specific functionality in the form of methods and attributes. In this reading, you’re going to learn more about object-oriented programming and how it works. Although this certificate program will not require you to define your own classes, having a basic understanding of how this process works will be very helpful when you encounter these concepts along your learning journey.

## Review: Attributes and methods

Python classes are powerful and convenient because they come with built-in features that simplify common data analysis tasks. These features are known as attributes and methods.

- **Attribute**: A value associated with an object or class which is referenced by name using dot notation.
    
- **Method**: A function that belongs to a class and typically performs an action or operation. 
    

A simpler way of thinking about the distinction between attributes and methods is to remember that attributes are _characteristics_ of the object, while methods are _actions_ or _operations_.

For example, if the class were Spaceship, then attributes might be:

- name

- kind

- speed

- tractor_beam

These attributes could be accessed by typing:

- Spaceship.name

- Spaceship.kind

- Spaceship.speed

- Spaceship.tractor_beam

Notice that these characteristics are accessed using only a dot. 

On the other hand, methods of the Spaceship class might be:

- warp()

- tractor()

These methods could be used by typing:

- Spaceship.warp() 

- Spaceship.tractor()

Notice that methods are followed by parentheses, and it’s possible for them to take arguments. For example, Spaceship.warp(7) could change the speed of the ship to warp seven.

## Defining classes with unique attributes and methods

Python lets you define your own classes, each with their own special attributes and methods. This helps all different kinds of programmers to build reusable code that makes their work more efficient. You can even build the Spaceship class mentioned previously. The example, here, demonstrates how to do this.

**Note:** The following code block is not interactive.

```
   tractor_beam = 'off'

   # Instance attributes

   def __init__(self, name, kind):

       self.name = name

       self.kind = kind

       self.speed = None

  # Instance methods

   def warp(self, warp):

       self.speed = warp

       print(f'Warp {warp}, engage!')

   def tractor(self):

       if self.tractor_beam == 'off':

           self.tractor_beam = 'on'

           print('Tractor beam on.')

       else:

           self.tractor_beam = 'off'

           print('Tractor beam off')
```

For this course you don’t have to learn the syntax to create classes. Just notice that the class itself is defined first, and then indented beneath it are the attributes and methods. This is what it means when an attribute or method “belongs to a class.” Attributes and methods are defined in the code for that class. 

A class is like a blueprint for all things that share characteristics and behaviors. In this case, the class is Spaceship. There can be all different kinds of spaceships. They can have different names and different purposes. Whenever you create an object of a given class, you’re creating an **instance** of that class. This is also known as **instantiating** the class. In the code above, every time you instantiate an object of the Spaceship class it will start with its tractor beam set to off. The tractor beam is a class attribute. All instances of the Spaceship class have one. There are also instance attributes. These are attributes that you can assign when you instantiate the object. 

```
# Create an instance of the Spaceship class (i.e. "instantiate")

ship = Spaceship('Mockingbird','rescue frigate')

# Check ship's name

print(ship.name)

# Check what kind of ship it is

print(ship.kind)

# Check tractor beam status

print(ship.tractor_beam)

# Result

Mockingbird
rescue frigate
off
```

The next block of code uses the warp() method to set the warp speed to seven. Then it checks the current speed of the ship using the speed attribute.

```
# Set warp speed

ship.warp(7)

# Check speed

ship.speed

# Result

Warp 7, engage!
7
```

This final block of code uses the tractor() method to toggle the tractor beam. Then it checks the current status of the tractor beam using the tractor_beam attribute.

```
# Toggle tractor beam

ship.tractor()

# Check tractor beam status

print(ship.tractor_beam)

# Result

Tractor beam on.
on
```

This is just a basic example meant to demonstrate some of the fundamental ways that classes, attributes, and methods work and how they relate to each other, but classes can be very complex and have many attributes and methods. Depending on the work you’re doing as a data professional, knowledge about object-oriented programming will be helpful as you define your own classes, attributes, and methods to investigate the patterns, relationships, and meaning data holds. 

## Key takeaways

Classes comprise the core objects of Python, which is why Python is known as an object-oriented language. Class objects are powerful because they contain unique tools designed specifically for that class packaged within them. Methods are functions that belong to a class; they perform actions or operations, and they use parentheses. Attributes are values or characteristics associated with a class or class instance; they do not use parentheses. And, while there are many classes, attributes, and methods pre-built into Python, there is a high level of customization offered in the object-oriented programming paradigm.

# Explore Python syntax

Python is a flexible programming language used in a wide range of fields, including software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, so getting familiar with its fundamental syntax and semantics will be useful for your future career. In this reading, you will learn about Python’s syntax and semantics, as well as where to find resources to further your learning.

## The Language of Python

People use language to communicate and give instructions to each other. Computers do the same thing, except computers use languages like Python, C++, and Java. So, in order to communicate instructions to the computer, programmers need to arrange ideas and concepts into a language it will understand.

Python syntax includes words that represent objects and commands, as well as punctuation that gives the words structure, hierarchy, and context. Together, the words and punctuation communicate ideas and processes; this is known as semantics. Semantics is the meaning conveyed by the syntax. The best way to learn syntax and semantics is through exposure. Practice coding and become familiar and comfortable with reading other people’s code. In addition, there are some general conventions that practitioners use to help maintain stylistic uniformity within the language. 

Coding languages are similar to spoken languages in that they have a way to classify words according to their function. For example, English sentences are composed of nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc.

Here are some of the basics:

- **Variables:** Represent data stored as strings, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and objects (note: future readings explain these categories)
    
    - Example: student_name
        
- **Keywords:** Special words that are reserved for specific purposes and that can only be used for those purposes
    
    - Examples:
        
        - in
            
        - not
            
        - or
            
        - for
            
        - while
            
        - return
            
- **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations on objects and values
    
    - Examples:
        
        - + Addition
            
        - - Subtraction
            
        - * Multiplication
            
        - / Division
            
        - ** Exponentiation
            
        - % Modulo (returns the remainder after a division). Example: 10 % 3 = 1
            
        - // Floor division (divides the first operand by the second operand and rounds the result down to the nearest integer. Example: 5 // 2 = 2
            
        - > Greater than (returns a Boolean of whether the left operand is greater than the right operand)
            
        - < Less than (returns a Boolean of whether the left operand is less than the right operand)
            
        - == Equality (returns a Boolean of whether the left operand is equal to the right operand)
            
- **Expressions:** A combination of numbers, symbols, and variables to compute and return a result upon evaluation
    
    - Example: [1, 2, 3] + [2, 4, 6]
        
- **Functions:** A group of related statements to perform a task and return a value
    
    - Example:
        

```
def to_celsius(x):

   '''Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius'''

   return (x-32) * 5/9

to_celsius(75)

# Result

23.88888888888889
```

- **Conditional statements:** Sections of code that direct program execution based on specified conditions
    
    - Example:
        

```
number = -4

if number > 0:

   print('Number is positive.')

elif number == 0:

   print('Number is zero.')

else:

   print('Number is negative.')

# Result

Number is negative.
```

As you’ll surely discover, Python generates syntax errors for incorrectly used keywords and syntax.

Example:

```
print(This will throw an error because I didn’t make it a string.)

# Result

Error on line 1:
    print(This will throw an error because I didn’t make it a string.)
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

## Naming rules and conventions

When assigning names to objects, programmers adhere to a set of rules and conventions which help to standardize code and make it more accessible to everyone. Here are some naming rules and conventions that you should know:

- Names cannot contain spaces.
    
- Names may be a mixture of upper and lower case characters.
    
- Names can’t start with a number but may contain numbers after the first character.
    
- Variable names and function names should be written in snake_case, which means that all letters are lowercase and words are separated using an underscore. 
    
- Descriptive names are better than cryptic abbreviations because they help other programmers (and you) read and interpret your code. For example, student_name is better than sn. It may feel excessive when you write it, but when you return to your code you’ll find it much easier to understand.
    

Tim Peters, a Python programmer, wrote this now-famous “poem” of guiding principles for coding in Python:

**The Zen of Python**

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Finally, it’s helpful to bookmark the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) so you can reference it as needed. This reading is limited in scope, and PEP 8 is a more exhaustive resource for style-related matters. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals. These are a running catalog of ways to improve or standardize Python as a language. Because Python is open source, PEP offers a framework to guide developers and build consensus around ideas. It’s a useful and trusted resource.

## Key takeaways

Syntax and semantics are what give form and meaning to a language, including Python.  A large part of learning a new language is familiarizing yourself with its syntax and semantics. Much of this comes through exposure and practice, but there are a few guiding principles and resources that can help you along the way. If you learn the rules about naming objects and build a bank of resources that you can reference for guidance, you’ll surely make progress as a Python learner. As you get more familiar with Python, you’ll be able to communicate more efficiently with computers and do more with your data analysis tools!

## Function syntax

Define functions using the following syntax and format:

**Note:** The following code block is not interactive.

```
def my_function(parameters):

    '''

    Docstring.

    Summarize the function's behavior and explain its arguments and return values.

    '''

    code block

    return value
```

1. Begin with the def keyword followed by the function’s name, then put its parameters/arguments in parentheses, ending with a colon.
    
    1. Python convention is to use snake_case (lowercase words separated by underscores) for function names.
        
2. For important functions or functions whose purposes or operations are not very obvious, include a docstring. Write the docstring between three opening and closing quotation marks. 
    
    1. The docstring should be in the form of a command (e.g., “Add two numbers” as opposed to “Adds two numbers”).
        
    2. The docstring should summarize the function’s behavior and explain its arguments and return values.
        
    3. The docstring should be indented four spaces from the definition statement.
        
3. Write the body of the function. 
    
    1. All code should be indented at least four spaces from the definition statement, but there can be many levels of indentation depending on the complexity of the code. 
        
4. Finally, use a return statement to return a value or a print statement to print something to the console and complete the function. This line should also be indented four spaces.
    

## **return vs. print**

Sometimes the difference between return statements and print statements isn’t clear to new learners of Python. It’s important to understand what each action is and when to use it. Return statements give you a result that you can use for something else. It doesn’t have to be something that prints when the function is run. Print statements print something to the console and nothing more. Think of it like this: a return statement is like your brother going to the market and bringing you back a bag of potatoes. A print statement is like your brother going to the market, coming home, and telling you what kind of potatoes were for sale. With the return statement, you have some potatoes to cook. With the print statement, you just know what potatoes are available, but you don’t have any potatoes.

## **Functions vs. methods**

Functions and methods are very similar, but there are a few key differences. Methods are a specific type of function. They are functions that belong to a class. This means that you can use them—or “call” them—by using dot notation. 

**Method example:** 

```
my_string = 'The eagles filled the sky.'

my_string.split()

['The', 'eagles', 'filled', 'the', 'sky.']
```

The split method is a function that belongs to the string class. It splits strings on their whitespaces. 

Standalone functions do not belong to a particular class and can often be used on multiple classes. 

**Note:** The following code block is not interactive.

**Function example:**

```
 sum([6, 3])

9
```

You can review [Python’s list of built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and research how other people use them in the [Jupyter forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and other online communities.

# Reference guide: Python operators

You’ve encountered many Python operators already. Many of them likely feel very familiar to you. After all, there’s nothing novel about addition and subtraction in Python. But there are many more operators than the ones used for basic arithmetic! Operators are characters that enact specific arithmetic, logical actions, or processes. Data professionals use operators all the time in their work, and they’re a rudimentary part of Python programming, so it’s important to learn them. This reading is a guide to the various operators available to you in Python.

## Comparators

In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a Boolean result—True or False. Python uses the following comparators:

| **Operation**            | **Operator** |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| greater than             | >            |
| greater than or equal to | >=           |
| less than                | <            |
| less than or equal to    | <=           |
| not equal to             | !=           |
| equal to                 | ==           |

**Notes:** 

- The single equals sign (=) is reserved for assignment statements. If you use a single equal sign to make a comparison, the computer will return a **SyntaxError**.
    
- If you try to compare data types that aren’t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a **TypeError**. 
    

## Logical operators

Python also has three logical operators that can be combined with comparators to create more complex statements.

These operators are:

- and
    
    - evaluates to True only if both statements are true 
        
- or
    
    - evaluates to True if one or both of the statements are true
        
- not
    
    - reverses the evaluation
        
    - If the statement evaluates to True, returns False; if the statement evaluates to False, returns True
        

Examples: 

```
x = 3

my_list = [3, 4, 6, 10]

print(x < 3 and x != 0)

print(x >= len(my_list) or x == min(my_list))

print(x not in my_list)

# Result

False
True
False
```

## Arithmetic operators

Python is also capable of performing mathematical operations using a set of built-in operators. These arithmetic operators are:

|**Operation**|**Operator**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|

There are many other mathematical operations that can be performed in Python using functions from special libraries, which you’ll learn about later. Python uses a core set of operators to make comparisons, perform logical operations, and compute arithmetic operations. These operators can be combined in statements to perform an infinite number of tasks and operations.

# Reference guide: Conditional statements

Conditional statements are an essential part of programming. They allow you to control the flow of information based on certain conditions. In Python, if, elif, and else statements are used to implement conditional statements. Using conditional statements to branch program execution is a core part of coding for most data professionals, so it’s important to understand how they work. This reading is a reference guide to conditional statements.

## Conditionals syntax

In earlier videos, you learned some built-in Python operators that allow you to compare values, and some logical operators that you can use to combine values. You also learned how to use operators in if-elif-else blocks. 

**Note**: The following code block is not interactive.

The basic syntax of if-elif-else statements in Python is as follows:

```
if condition1:

   # block of code to execute if the condition evaluates to True

elif condition2:

   # block of code to execute if condition1 evaluates to False

   # and condition2 evaluates to True

else:

   # block of code to execute if BOTH condition1 and condition2

   # evaluate to False
```

Here, condition1 and condition2 are expressions that evaluate to either True or False. If the condition in the if statement is true, then the block of code that follows is executed. Otherwise, it is skipped.

The elif statement stands for “else if,” and it is used to specify an alternative condition to check if the first condition is false. You can have any number of elif statements in your code. If the preceding condition is false and the elif condition is true, then the block of code that follows the elif statement is executed.

The else statement is used to specify what code to execute if both the if statement and any subsequent elif statements are false. 

Here is an example that uses all three kinds of statements:

```
x = 8

if x > 5:

   print('x is greater than five')

elif x < 5:

   print('x is less than five')

else:

   print('x is equal to five')

# Result

x is greater than five
```

Some important things to note about conditional statements in Python:

- The elif and else statements are optional. You can have an if statement by itself.
    
- You can have multiple elif statements.
    
- You can only have one else statement, and only at the end of your logic block.
    
- The conditions must be an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (True or False).
    
- Indentation matters! The code associated with each conditional statement must be indented below it. The typical convention for data professionals is to indent four spaces. Indentation mistakes are one of the most common causes of unexpected code behavior.
