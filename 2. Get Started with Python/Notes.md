## Healthy habits for course completion

Here is a list of best practices that will help you complete the courses in the program in a timely manner:

- **Plan your time:** Setting regular study times and following them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to set achievable goals. Find a space that allows you to focus when you watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities.
    
- **Work at your own pace:** Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, feel free to progress through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. You can extend your deadlines at any time by going to **Overview** in the navigation panel and selecting **Switch Sessions**. If you have already missed previous deadlines, select **Reset my deadlines** instead.
    
- **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The steps you take to support your learning along the way will advance your knowledge, create more opportunities in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs. 
    
- **Take notes:** Notes will help you remember important information in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
    
- **Review exemplars:** Exemplars are completed assignments that fully meet an activity's criteria. Many activities in this program have exemplars for you to compare to your own work. Although there are often many ways to complete an assignment, exemplars offer you guidance and inspiration about how to complete the activity. 
    
- **Chat (responsibly) with other learners:** If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Use the [discussion forums](https://www.coursera.org/learn/get-started-with-python/discussions) to ask for help from other learners taking this program.

# Python versus other programming languages

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, which makes it a great addition to your data analytics toolbox! As we’ve previously investigated, Python’s use of syntax to communicate commands and perform tasks mirrors spoken language. This makes Python a much easier programming language to learn. Python’s structure is similar to many other programming languages, but there are some key differences to consider as well.

In this reading, you’ll learn how Python compares to other programming languages data professionals use, including R, Java, and C++. 

## Five considerations of programming languages

Python isn’t the only programming language used for data analysis, but it is one of the most widely used and most powerful. Many data professionals even use more than one programming language. Every language has benefits and drawbacks. For the purposes of this course, examine the following considerations: speed, approachability, variables, data science focus, and programming paradigm.

### **Speed**

There are many factors that contribute to the speed of a program’s execution, including compile time, runtime, hardware, installed dependencies, and the efficiency of the code itself. In general, low-level programming languages are faster, but they’re more difficult to learn and work with. 

### **Approachability**

Approachability refers to how easy it is for new learners to start using a language. Learning new programming languages can be challenging depending on their syntax and overall structure. The **syntax** is the structure of code words, symbols, placement, and punctuation. Semantics builds meaning into those structures by using variables and objects. Additionally, those variables help add flexibility to the programs and objects where data is housed. 

### **Variables**

Information in code is stored in variables. A **variable** is a named container which stores values in a reserved location in the computer’s memory. The way a programming language uses variables will have an effect on a system's core operations or kernel speed. Some languages use static variables to maintain a value throughout the entire run of a program. Others approach variables as dynamic, allowing values to be determined when a program is run. Some languages even allow declarative variables, which enable a program to determine where a variable should be placed. 

### **Data science focus**

Programming languages have individual characteristics and can better serve different tasks in data analysis; this means programmers often use them for specific data science tasks. 

### **Programming paradigm**

Programming languages can be object-oriented, functional, or imperative. Object-oriented programming languages are modeled around data objects. Functional programming languages are modeled around functions. Imperative languages are modeled around code statements that can alter the state of the program itself. 

## Programming language comparisons

Python, R, Java and C++ are four of the most commonly used programming languages for data analysis. The following chart compares them using five considerations: speed, accessibility, variable, data science focus, and programming paradigm. 

|**Features by Software**|**Python**|**R**|**Java**|**C++**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Speed**|Slower|Depends on configuration and add-ons|Faster|Very fast|
|**Approachability**|Easy to learn|Complex|Easy to learn|Complex|
|**Variable**|Dynamic|Dynamic|Static|Declarative|
|**Data science focus**|Machine learning and automated analysis|Exploratory data analysis and building extensive statistical libraries|Used across projects with open-source assets|Not as widely used but very powerful implementations|
|**Programming Paradigm**|Object-oriented|Functional language|Object-oriented|Multi-paradigm (imperative & object-oriented)|

## Key takeaways

There are a number of different programming languages that can be used for data analysis. Each language has its own benefits and drawbacks. Learning to work with different languages will give you the opportunity to broaden your data skills and access new tools for your analysis. However, in this certificate program, Python will be your sole focus. As mentioned previously, Python is an easy to learn, object-oriented programming language that engages dynamic variables; though it sometimes requires a longer time to execute, it is a great tool for machine learning and automated analysis.# How to use Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, mathematical formulas, visualizations, and text. This is a great tool to develop and present code in a standardized text block format that is interactive and shareable. You can create code, mathematical formulas, data visualizations, and even freestyle text—all in Jupyter notebooks!

You will be using Jupyter notebooks to write, execute, and present your own code throughout this program. This reading will guide you through using your own notebook. Note, however, that for this certificate program you do not need to download any software. You can complete all activities with the tools provided on the Coursera platform.

# Jupyter Notebook

You can access Jupyter Notebook directly from your browser or download the desktop application onto your device to work with over 100 programming languages, including some you might already know like R and Python. There is [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the full suite of tools for working with computational notebooks. There is also [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a more streamlined and simplified tool that nonetheless offers powerful ways to perform interactive computing. Again, for this certificate program, we recommend working within the Jupyter Notebook interface provided by Coursera. Activities that use Jupyter notebooks will be labeled as labs, and you will find relevant instructions for each activity on its landing page.

# Why Jupyter Notebook?

Notebooks are particularly useful for working with data. Here are some ways that Jupyter notebooks excel:

1. **Modular/interactive computing:** You can write and execute individual chunks of code in small, manageable chunks, which are called cells. You can run a cell without necessarily having to run the whole notebook. This is especially helpful for data exploration and experimentation. Cells are also helpful with debugging, because they provide a user-friendly way to make a mistake, notice that you made the mistake, and iterate back to correct your mistake, without having to re-execute a whole script.
    
2. **Integration of code and documentation:** Notebooks allow you to combine code, textual explanations, and visualizations like charts, graphs, and tables—all in a single document. 
    
3. **Support for multiple languages:** The Advanced Data Analytics program will use Python, but Jupyter notebooks support many other languages, making them powerful and versatile.
    
4. **Data exploration and analysis:** The notebook simplifies working with data by offering tools to load, clean, analyze, and examine it in an elegant interface.
    
5. **Cloud-based services:** Many cloud computing platforms host Jupyter notebooks, which makes it easy to run and share notebooks without setting up a local environment. This is very useful for collaboration.
    
6. **Libraries and extensions:** There is a rich ecosystem of extensions and plugins that enhance functionality for whatever type of project you’re working on.

# How to use Jupyter notebooks

Once you’ve opened a Jupyter notebook, it’s time to use it! Here are some tips to get started.

## Command/edit mode

Notebooks have two working modes: command mode and edit mode. Command mode is used to interact with the notebook as a whole and perform actions like adding, moving, and deleting cells. Edit mode is used to type code or markdown text into a particular cell. 

Command mode is indicated by a blue bar on the left side of the current cell.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/8c605b1f-b710-43de-a0de-b64050a63779)

Edit mode is indicated by a green bar on the left and also a thin green border around the active cell.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/7bdf2c52-efb3-4c61-aaf6-f431eb69f944)

To enter into edit mode, simply click into a cell to insert your cursor there or use the navigation arrows on your keyboard to select a cell and press Enter. To revert back to command mode, click anywhere outside the cell or press the escape key.

## Markdown mode

Jupyter notebooks allow you to toggle cells between coding mode and Markdown mode. Markdown is a markup language that lets you add formatting elements to plain text. It’s useful because it’s ubiquitous, future-proof, and platform independent. In Jupyter notebooks, Markdown text is used to provide written explanations, analysis, and context to explain the code and its output. In the following example, all of the text above In [41]: was written and formatted using Markdown.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/00f6815a-fca8-4a6d-b838-038a55f64580)

To toggle between code and Markdown mode, go to the menu at the top of the page and click where it says “Code.” Then, select “Markdown” from the dropdown menu that appears.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/df52ceee-3f35-4214-a032-8f0032e47ea8)

For more information about how to use Markdown, refer to [Markdown guide for basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and the [Markdown guide for extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/).

## Common actions

Most actions can be performed using both a mouse/graphic interface and keyboard shortcuts. Here are some of the most common actions.

### Add a new cell

- Click on Insert in the menu bar at the top of the notebook. Options are to insert a new cell above or below the current cell.
    
- Keyboard shortcuts (while in command mode):
    
    - **a:** Insert a cell above the current cell
        
    - **b:** Insert a cell below the current cell
        

### Delete a cell

- Use command mode to select a cell or group of cells.
    
- Click on Edit in the menu bar at the top of the notebook and select Delete Cells from the dropdown menu.
    
- Keyboard shortcut (while in command mode): 
    
    - **dd** (press D two times)
        

### Move a cell

- Use command mode to select a cell or group of cells.
    
- Click on the up arrow button or down arrow button in the menu bar at the top of the notebook to move the selected cell(s) up or down 
    

### Run a cell

- Select a cell and click the **Run** button in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.
    
- Keyboard shortcuts:
    
    - **Ctrl + Enter:** Run selected cell
        
    - **Shift + Enter:** Run selected cell and select next cell
        
    - **Alt + Enter:** Run selected cell and insert new cell below
        
- You can run cells from both command mode and edit mode
    

Press **h** while in command mode for a pop-up window with all available keyboard shortcuts. You can also check out [Jupyter Notebook interface components](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ui_components.html) for more detailed descriptions of various notebook features.

# Troubleshooting

You will use Jupyter notebooks throughout the Advanced Data Analytics certificate program. At times, you might encounter difficulty accessing or running the notebook. Here are some troubleshooting steps to help you if this happens.

## Browser compatibility

Make sure your internet browser is updated regularly. It is best to use the latest version of Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. If your browser is outdated or you are using a browser that is not supported by Coursera, you may encounter a problem. If your browser is up to date and you are using one of the browsers listed above and still encountering problems, try restarting your browser or clearing your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also use incognito mode, which prevents your browser from storing cookies and other temporary data.

## Internet connection

Coursera requires a stable internet connection. If you are experiencing problems starting or running a Jupyter notebook, your internet connection may be slow or unreliable. Some signs of an unstable internet connection may be pages failing to load, freezing labs, or the inability to type or enter commands within the lab environment. 

**Pro Tip:** If you are unable to complete a lab on one device, try using another device.

## Troubleshooting steps

To summarize, here are the troubleshooting steps to try if you encounter a problem with Jupyter notebooks in Coursera. 

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of a supported browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
    
2. Restart your browser and clear your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also use incognito mode.
    
3. Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable. You can try restarting your router and modem to regain a stable connection.
    
4. Try restarting the lab again.
    

If all this fails, it’s possible that Coursera is performing maintenance or experiencing a service interruption. In that case, wait a little while and try again.

# Key takeaways

Jupyter Notebook provides a coding platform where you can develop and debug your own code. Knowing how to use and interact with notebooks will prepare you for upcoming activities where you will try out new Python skills and prepare for the end-of-course project. Python will be a great tool in your toolkit—it will open up more advanced analytics tools like machine learning and automated analysis. And, using Jupyter Notebook will be a great way to build your Python knowledge!
