Find a space that allows you to focus when you watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities.
    
- **Work at your own pace:** Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, feel free to progress through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. You can extend your deadlines at any time by going to **Overview** in the navigation panel and selecting **Switch Sessions**. If you have already missed previous deadlines, select **Reset my deadlines** instead.
    
- **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The steps you take to support your learning along the way will advance your knowledge, create more opportunities in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs. 
    
- **Take notes:** Notes will help you remember important information in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
    
- **Review exemplars:** Exemplars are completed assignments that fully meet an activity's criteria. Many activities in this program have exemplars for you to compare to your own work. Although there are often many ways to complete an assignment, exemplars offer you guidance and inspiration about how to complete the activity. 
    
- **Chat (responsibly) with other learners:** If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Use the [discussion forums](https://www.coursera.org/learn/go-beyond-the-numbers-translate-data-into-insight/discussions) to ask for help from other learners taking this program.

**Module 1: Find and share stories using data**

There are trends and stories hidden among the numbers and tables inside almost every dataset. In this part of the program, you will learn to tell stories using data and how to discover those stories by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. You’ll learn about the benefits and basic methods of data cleaning. You will explore different ways to visualize data and choose among them to suit the type of data you’re representing and your audience. 

**Module 2: Explore raw data**

Cleaning a never-before-seen dataset can be daunting, but there is no need to fear. For this part of the program, you will be making sense of raw data by using powerful functions and libraries in Python. You will learn to perform EDA practices of discovering and structuring using Python, and you’ll discover that finding stories using EDA and the PACE workflow is all about gaining a thorough understanding of your data. 

**Module 3: Clean your data**

At this point in the course, you’ll know what is in your dataset, but what’s next? In this part of the program, you will learn three more EDA practices: cleaning, joining, and validating. You will learn the importance of performing these practices on your data, and you’ll practice using Python notebooks to clean, validate, and join data. 

**Module 4: Data visualizations and presentations**

Once you have learned how to find the story and clean the data, it’s time to share it with others.
