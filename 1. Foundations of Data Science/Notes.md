# Volunteer data skills to make a positive impact 

So far, you have been learning how data analytics professionals are making an impact in a variety of industries. You’ve also learned about nonprofit organizations, and how their efforts are making a difference for so many in need. By volunteering their expertise and time, data analytics professionals contribute to many projects that help nonprofits benefit communities all around the world. In this reading, you will learn more about how you can contribute to global efforts, including  your local community as a data professional.

## Nonprofits

People hoping to further a social cause, or provide a benefit to the public, often create nonprofit groups. The main mission of a nonprofit group is to fill a need or gap that the private sector is not addressing adequately. There are rewarding and inspiring opportunities for data professionals in the nonprofit sector. At the global level, groups like [Children International](https://www.children.org/), [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/), and [Care International](https://www.care-international.org/) lead humanitarian efforts across the globe. In addition to these large-scale efforts, there are many nonprofit organizations whose efforts are regionally specific, like [Christopher’s Promise](http://www.christopherspromise.org/) based in the Columbus, Ohio area.

You can apply your data skills to help nonprofit groups become more effective, allowing them to anticipate and respond to their greatest areas of need. 

You may already be aware of nonprofits that fit within your areas of interest or operate in your community. One way that these organizations compensate for their lack of resources is by finding volunteers. Often, regional or local organizations lack the resources to offer full time employment for marketing professionals or data analysts. As a data analytics professional there are many ways that you can make a valuable contribution to nonprofit organizations. In the event that you do not have a specific nonprofit organization in mind, you can research through [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), the largest and most trusted online nonprofit evaluation and rating tool in the world. Here you will find ratings on nearly 200,000 nonprofits.

## An example of a community-based nonprofit organization

[Christopher’s Promise](http://www.christopherspromise.org/home.html), a grass-roots nonprofit based in Columbus, Ohio, is a representative example of the types of community-based nonprofits that are making an impact all over the world. This organization was inspired by the efforts to create a bicycle for a fifteen-year old who faced the challenges of Neurofibromatosis, Cerebral Palsy, and Optic Glioma. Since 2011, this nonprofit has facilitated the design and construction of adaptive bicycles for hundreds of children, thanks to outstanding support from the local communities in the central Ohio area.

Christopher’s Promise (2022) mission statement is  “To allow all kids, despite physical limitations, the ability to experience the same hallmark childhood memories as their peers. Helping kids, be kids.” 

## Volunteering data skills to nonprofits

As a data analytics professional, your skills can make a great impact on charity and nonprofit organizations within your own community or for a community whose needs resonate with you. Many nonprofits are highly dependent on volunteers for their activities due to limited resources. This situation is especially challenging for community-based initiatives that often lack the funding to hire data analytics professionals. Therefore, offering to volunteer with a local nonprofit is an excellent way to gain experience and support a cause. 

### How can data analytics professionals help nonprofits?

Data analytics professionals can help nonprofit organizations in a variety of ways. Below are a few examples.

#### Fundraising

Using data analytics, you can predict with high accuracy which prospects are most likely to donate. In order to maximize return on marketing and outreach expenses, nonprofit organizations can use data analysis to prioritize outreach and reduce overall marketing expenditures.

#### Marketing

There is valuable information in a nonprofit’s data that can benefit marketing efforts. Data analysis can help determine a nonprofit’s target audience and gather insights such as donation methods, contribution history, and other demographics. As a result, the nonprofit can help guide communication with potential donors and determine the effectiveness of campaigns.

#### Monitoring activities

Data analysis can help nonprofits monitor resources, expenses, and daily operational needs. A nonprofit will often need assistance in keeping track of donated materials. For example, a database of donations to a food bank could help the organization determine specific food items being collected and inventory the expiration dates of food items for shelving, cycling, and distribution. Using a system of real-time inventory in conjunction with predictive data analytics could anticipate shortages and identify those donors who have helped provide these items in the past.

Data analytics has a lot to offer a nonprofit organization. Gaining deeper insight into the organization’s efforts can help them to operate in a more effective and efficient way. Analyzing data can improve various nonprofit functions, such as allocation of resources, recruiting and retaining supporters, fundraising, and conducting research. Data analysis also can help reveal patterns and power dynamics that can be used to inform decision-making. In addition to identifying individuals and communities in need of assistance, predictive modeling can also be used to identify potential recipients of a nonprofit's services.

## More opportunities to volunteer

There are organizations who are helping to pair data professionals with projects that are making a difference all around the world. 

DataKind is a global nonprofit that harnesses the power of data science and artificial intelligence (“AI”) in the service of humanity. Using data analysis, this organization guides restorative efforts in underserved communities. DataKind brings together volunteer experts from academia and industry to design innovative solutions to tough social challenges. They help social organizations apply their data to predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and AI in a way that both increases impact and is sensitive to ethical considerations. Visit the [DataKind website](https://www.datakind.org/join-us/volunteer/) to find out more about their mission and how to become a volunteer.

Another option for putting your data skills to good use are hackathons. A hackathon is an event where programmers and other data professionals come together and collaborate on a particular project. The goal is to create a solution to an existing problem. 

There are many hackathon events scheduled across the world each year. These events can take place at a specific location or remotely across the globe. Hackathon events are commonly built around a central theme or question, such as tracking industrial emissions, promoting healthy food options, or how we can improve mental health for cancer patients. If you are interested in finding listings of current hackathons around the world, visit [Devpost.com](https://devpost.com/).

## Key takeaways

Donating your time to a nonprofit is a great way to gain experience, and it can be mutually beneficial for you and the nonprofit. The nonprofit benefits from your data analysis expertise, and you get valuable experience working with data that can be added to your professional portfolio.

Working with a nonprofit organization or participating in a hackathon event introduces you to different types of projects, enhances interpersonal and communications skills, and adds to your professional list of contacts. No matter what your level of data analytics experience, working with nonprofits and hackathons can be a rewarding side project, or even a philanthropic career option.

# Critical data security and privacy principles

You have learned how data analytics can be used for good causes, like assisting nonprofit organizations. Also, you learned that data professionals need to protect privacy within data and remain aware of other considerations, like data bias and making assumptions about data. 

As a data analytics professional, you have a responsibility to handle data ethically. Data ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. Throughout your career you will work with a lot of data. This sometimes includes PII, or **personally identifiable information,** which can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. One element of treating data ethically is ensuring that the privacy and security of that data is maintained throughout its lifetime. In this reading, you will learn more about the importance of data privacy and some strategies for protecting the privacy of data subjects. 

## Privacy matters

Data privacy means preserving a data subject’s information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is also called information privacy or data protection. Data privacy is concerned with the access, use, and collection of personal data. For the people whose data is being collected, this means they have the right to:

- Protection from unauthorized access to their private data
    
- Freedom from inappropriate use of their data
    
- The right to inspect, update, or correct their data
    
- Ability to give consent to data collection
    
- Legal right to access the data
    

In order to maintain these rights, businesses and organizations have to put privacy measures in place to protect individuals’ data. This is also a matter of trust. The public’s ability to trust companies with personal data is important. It’s what makes people want to use a company’s product, share their information, and more. 

## Protecting privacy with data anonymization 

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/ef776084-4a26-4df8-b27e-a262c10b9a45)

Organizations use a lot of different measures to protect the privacy of their data subjects, like incorporating access permissions to ensure that only the people who are supposed to access that information can do so. Another key strategy to maintaining privacy is data anonymization. 

**Data anonymization** is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

Data professionals can take additional measures to protect users and their data. **Data aggregation**, for example, is the process of collecting and combining details from a significant number of users in terms of totals or summary. Aggregating data ensures that information contained within datasets is shown in groups; when coupled with other anonymization techniques, data professionals can ensure compliance with data privacy and anonymization standards.

Data anonymization is used in just about every industry. As a data analytics professional, you probably won’t personally be performing anonymization, but it’s useful to understand what kinds of data are often anonymized before you start working with it. This data might include:

- Telephone numbers
    
- Names
    
- License plates and license numbers
    
- Social security numbers
    
- IP addresses
    
- Medical records
    
- Email addresses
    
- Photographs
    
- Account numbers
    

Imagine a world where we all had access to each other’s addresses, account numbers, and other identifiable information. That would invade a lot of people’s privacy and make the world less safe. Data anonymization is one of the ways we can help keep data private and secure!

## Key takeaways

For any professional working with data about actual people, it’s important to consider the safety and privacy of those individuals. That’s why understanding the importance of data privacy and how data that contains PII can be made secure for analysis is so important. We have a responsibility to protect people’s data and the personal information that data might contain.

# The practices and principles of good data stewardship

As you have been learning, all data professionals are responsible for ensuring the quality, integrity, accessibility, and security of data. Data stewardship is the practice of ensuring that data is accessible, usable, and safe. Making data stewardship a normal part of your work habits will benefit everyone who relies on your analysis, both inside and outside of your organization. In this reading, you will learn more about data stewardship and receive some best practices that can assist in guiding your career in data analytics.

## Respect privacy

Earlier in this course, you learned about Information that permits the identity of an individual to be inferred by either direct or indirect means. This kind of information is commonly referred to as personally identifiable information or PII. When users share personal information, they are putting a high level of trust into an organization. It is the responsibility of all who have access within the organization to help protect the privacy of their users. As a data analytics professional, it is important to be thoughtful about any personal data and exhibit great care to protect it. In different parts of the world, laws are in place to guide best practices for data privacy. Laws provide a foundation for best practices as you grow in knowledge and experience on how to support and sustain privacy. One of your responsibilities as a data professional will be to stay up to date with any change in data laws and regulations that govern data. Depending on your organization’s location or industry considerations, there may be additional regulations and policies in place. Here are a couple of regional examples:

- General Data Protection Regulation or [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) (European Union law):
    
    - The GDPR is described on their website as the toughest privacy and security law in the world. It imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the European Union.
        
- Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or [LGPD](https://www.gov.br/cidadania/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/lgpd) (Brazil’s general law for the protection of personal data):
    
    - The LGPD is a data protection law that governs how companies collect, use, disclose, and process personal data belonging to people in Brazil. LGPD applies to companies that process data about individuals in Brazil.
        
- The California Consumers Privacy Act or [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) (Privacy rights for California consumers):
    
    - The CCPA gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them. These regulations provide guidance on how to implement the law.
        
    - Additionally, states like Virginia, Colorado, New York, Utah, and Connecticut have enacted similar legislation to protect consumer privacy in their states.
        

## Be cautious of unintentional harm

Data analytics is expanding its influence across an increasing range of industries. Companies are using the results of data analysis to make informed decisions. Many of these decisions have the potential to impact people across a broad range of social and economic factors. It is good practice to continually strive to produce information that is accurate, while respecting cultural and social norms. 

Due to the global marketplace, decisions play out differently in different cultures. Taking these issues and considerations into account is very important for the executive team of an organization. Also, companies are known to take a position on particular politicized social and cultural issues, and these can be reflected in their policies. As a data analytics professional, you must be cognizant of your company’s policies. When presented with challenges, it is best to seek guidance from leadership within your organization on how to navigate.

## Avoid creating or reinforcing bias

You have learned about bias within data and how it can have an impact on your analysis. Identifying bias is not always simple. A good practice when working with data is to keep in mind that data gathering is a task managed by humans–and that process is informed by people from different backgrounds, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews. These and other types of biases can affect the data and the results, which in turn can have an impact on business decisions. You will learn more about bias within data as you progress through the program. 

## Consider inclusivity

Often in your role as a data analytics professional, you will have access to data collected in a variety of ways. You will need to consider whether the methods of data collection have excluded information from particular populations. Inclusionary approaches can expand how any organization collects and analyzes data. Building diverse research teams, communicating clearly with user communities, and engaging in careful and critical analysis that considers equity and inclusion benefits all stakeholders.

## Uphold high standards of scientific excellence

The processes and technology that you will interact with as a data analytics professional are deeply rooted in the scientific method. As you continue in your data professional journey, embrace inquiry, intellectual discussion, and collaboration. Invite feedback and assess feedback. Remember, artificial intelligence still depends heavily on the instructions provided by data professionals. The more time and consideration that goes into the process of data analytics, the better the results.

Different industries have different standards. In your role as a data analytical professional, you will need to be aware of the standards for the industries you are working in. Each industry will have its own standards based on industry conventions.

Conventions that work well in the transportation industry may not necessarily be as high of a priority for the healthcare industry. For example, in transportation, data is collected to create predictive analytics models to analyze the best route based on traffic patterns. In the healthcare industry, data is analyzed in medical imaging, predicting genetic factors, and speeding up the development of treatments.

## Data stewardship and ethics conversations

As you progress through your career as a data analytics professional, you will need to consider issues of ethical concern. For example, you may encounter situations where you address questions of bias or need to protect user data and personally identifiable information (PII). When these types of questions arise, many seek guidance and support from online communities of data professionals who have dealt with similar issues. The following graphics present scenarios involving these kinds of issues. You can also find text alternative versions of these conversations in the [Data stewardship and ethics conversations transcript.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1REAcRzABhtysbB4Nt8h7Gyqu3Sjv4cLfNC-7ETzauSg/template/preview#)

## Key takeaways

Data stewardship is the responsibility of every data professional. This responsibility goes beyond interactions with the data. By conducting your work in ways that are socially beneficial and inclusive, you will increase your ability to identify human bias. Guide your efforts through scientific and ethical principles and stay aware of possible bias throughout the data analysis process.

# Build the perfect data team

You have been learning about the role of data analytics professionals within organizations and the work they perform. You’ve also examined some general classifications for data professional roles.  Additionally, you explored what a typical data analytics profession might experience during the initial days in a new position. Large organizations often have more data needs, requiring the creation of teams to take on projects. In this reading, you will learn more about how organizations build data analytics teams and look at some best practices when constructing them.

## **Designing data analytics teams**

The idea of companies creating teams of data professionals developed over time and largely out of necessity. Originally, the responsibilities of data collection, management, and analysis fell onto the CIO (chief information officer) of the company. CIOs in the past would typically hand the responsibilities over to the IT (Informational technology) team. 

Gradually, organizations began separating data functions as the wealth of information stored grew. Additionally, new technologies emerged and data-related tasks became more specialized.

### Data professional profiles within large organizations

Earlier in this course, you were introduced to some data professional profiles.

- Data Scientist
    
- Data Analyst
    
- Data Engineer
    
- Analytic Team Manager
    
- Business Intelligence Engineer
    

These profiles are very generalized categories that can help you focus your eventual job search. In reality, many employers are looking for more than data professionals. They are looking for project stakeholders, dependable team members, and great co-workers.

### Building the team

The data needs of larger companies requires the creation of a team of skilled professionals. The members of these teams each have a specialized area of expertise. Some will come from business backgrounds, some with project or staff management experience, while others will have more technical skills. While there is no checklist available for companies to follow when putting together their team of data professionals, the needs of their organization can help guide them.

Creating a team of data analytics professionals is very similar to how sports franchises put together championship-level rosters. Coaches and general managers are always looking to upgrade and enhance the capabilities of their teams. While having a superstar athlete can help deliver a consistent performance at a certain position, their abrupt departure can compromise the team’s overall performance. A better approach is to develop a well-balanced and collaborative team. 

Employers want to hire someone who has more than data analytic skills. They are selecting the best fit for their organization. Candidates who bring additional experience and skills beyond data analytics are most often seen as most favorable. Strong interpersonal and communication skills, experience working in business, or within a team dynamic can enhance data analytics. There is a very good chance that you already possess some of these skills.

## Five principles for data team building

After you join a data team, there are still challenges to building a data-driven organization. Below you will find five principles that can guide any organization to becoming more effective when facing the challenges of data analysis, regardless of the structure of your data teams within the company. 

### 1. Adaptability

Data platforms, networks and storage options need to allow flexibility. Each data professional will have their preferences as to the tools and their approaches to analysis. Remote and on-site employees need to have access and the ability to work with all data and use the tools of communication they feel are the most productive.

Organizations need to facilitate a data platform that allows open access to resources for all users. Instead of specifying specific software solutions, organizations can expand their pool of candidates by allowing individuals to integrate the tools and applications they are most comfortable and experienced with. Flexibility invites a wide range of experience and enhances data teams, adding experience and additional perspectives.

Just as organizations need to be adaptable, those seeking opportunities in data fields should be committed to learning new skills and technologies. Data workplaces are undergoing constant change, as you learned earlier. As a data analytics professional, you will continue to learn and grow as newer technologies or regulations emerge.  Accept the challenge presented by new circumstances and let yourself feel energized when presented with opportunities for professional growth.

**Pro tip:** Keep your desire for learning. Expand your knowledge through online data science communities and educational opportunities.

### 2. Activation

Access to data analysis results require someone with the background and experience of a data analyst. Even small-scale data operations require skills that go beyond the scope of other professionals within an organization.

To become more data literate, organizations should cultivate new habits and integrate them into their daily work routines. Dashboards and other accessible interfaces can help promote the use of data analysis, enabling wider usage of data analysis, promoting communication and fostering cross-departmental collaboration.

Vital to the success of an organization's efforts to transform its internal habits and culture are the interpersonal skills of its employees. When a company is seeking to expand data literacy, its data professionals play an important role. There will be opportunities to help promote understanding among peers and colleagues. The time spent answering questions and promoting understanding will help others appreciate you and your contributions to the organization.

**Pro tip:** Maintain positive professional relationships through effective communication. Your ability to share insights is just as important to an organization as your analyzing skills.

### 3. Standardization

An organization needs to set criteria for the standardization of data practices and procedures. Standardization helps to promote best practices, and communication and transferability of information between teams. When users can share optimized code and other assets it saves development time and streamlines projects. An organization that builds a culture of collaboration embeds best practices into work behaviors.

Identifying candidates with capabilities beyond data analysis is essential to developing and standardizing best practices. To develop best practices, organizations need employees that contribute innovative solutions to problems. 

**Pro tip:** Become a problem solver. Obstacles within a project can turn into opportunities for innovation, which can transform an organization.

### 4. Accountability

Data analysis is a complex and dynamic process that requires a high level of accountability. To promote responsibility, organizations need a ‘paper trail’ that allows examination of their entire process.

Accountability adds transparency, explainability, and security to data teams and projects. It also helps to eliminate layers within an organization, while aligning business goals and customer values. Transparency in workflow allows organizations to answer specific questions about the data analysis process. Data analytics professionals can use project metadata to examine and communicate specific elements within their prediction models, giving data teams the collaborative ability to make adjustments with more precision.

One way to promote accountability is to extend your ability to communicate throughout your workflow. Within data analytical projects, the transfer of ideas extends beyond individual correspondence. It also includes information in project notes, records kept within projects, and proper tagging within metadata. Individual processes and ideas are the incubators of standards of practice and communicating these ideas effectively can improve an organization’s accountability.

**Pro tip:** Data analytics professionals are more than repositories of information. It benefits everyone involved in a project if you are able to communicate your knowledge and observations. Identify what would be most valuable to others and provide the information.

### 5. Business impact

Often, the inability to estimate the impact on the business can block data analysis projects. Organizations are not considering all available data analytical solutions during the planning stage.

Organizations should look at approaching data projects with the widest field of view in the planning stage. This requires a thoughtful approach including considerations beyond data analysis.  For example, the difficulty of integration, commitment of resources, and changes to the project timeline. Businesses need to consider more data solutions options and identify which benefit the project the most.

Broadening the scope of an organization takes time and consistency of results. To achieve this, a data team must become a trusted resource for insight and a positive influence on an organization's decision-making process. An effective communication strategy, strong interpersonal skills, and a track record of problem-solving will earn the trust of the organization. 

**Pro tip:** Focus on communicating clearly with stakeholders. Maintain a commitment to consistency between what you have promised and what you will deliver. 

## Key takeaways

Organizations carefully consider the individuals they bring into their organization and seek candidates that embody qualities that go beyond data skills. Additionally, companies can influence their adaptability by hiring data professionals that embody the spirit of lifelong learning, effective communication, interpersonal skills, and the ability to solve problems.

# How data professionals use AI

Earlier, you briefly considered the role of artificial intelligence in data science. You may recall that **artificial intelligence (AI)** refers to the development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. For example, practical applications of AI include voice assistants, autonomous vehicles, automated recommendation systems, and more.

In this reading, you will learn more about the uses of AI for data work, and how AI can help data professionals better understand their data and make more informed decisions. You’ll also learn about the limitations of AI, and the differences between AI and human data professionals. 

## The uses of AI for data work

Data professionals can use AI to improve their data analysis, perform essential tasks, and streamline their workflow. For example, data professionals can use AI to:

- Create predictive models to help accurately forecast future events or outcomes. 
    
- Automate time-consuming tasks such as data cleaning, coding, and report writing. 
    
- Analyze extremely large datasets. 
    
- Improve the quality of data by identifying and correcting errors. 
    
- Generate insights from data that would not be obvious to humans. 
    
- Provide guidance on tasks such as choosing the right algorithms and interpreting results. 
    
- Facilitate collaboration among team members. 
    

Data professionals can leverage AI to enhance the quality and efficiency of their data projects, generate valuable insights, and help stakeholders make better business decisions. 

### **Conversational AI tools: Gemini and ChatGPT**

Many data professionals now use conversational AI tools to help them analyze their data and boost their productivity. Two of the most frequently used tools are Gemini and ChatGPT.  Gemini was created by Google AI. ChatGPT, also known as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was developed by OpenAI. 

Gemini and ChatGPT are both **large language models (LLMs)** that are trained on massive datasets of text and code. An LLM is a type of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques to identify patterns in text and map how different words and phrases relate to each other. This allows LLMs to predict what word should come next. LLMs can generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. 

**Note**: This is a general introduction to LLMs. A detailed discussion of the development and computational logic of LLMs is beyond the scope of this course. 

Tools like Gemini and ChatGPT can help data professionals in a variety of ways. A data professional might ask Gemini or ChatGPT to: 

- Clean a dataset by removing missing values, outliers, and duplicate data.
    
- Create interactive data visualizations such as dashboards and heatmaps. 
    
- Recommend a specific algorithm for a particular task based on the data professional's input.
    
- Create a shared document to facilitate a brainstorming session among a team of data professionals. 
    

**Note**: This is a brief list of possible prompts. In another activity, you’ll get a chance to further explore Gemini and discover its capabilities.

## Use cases for AI

Data professionals across industries use AI to help analyze data and generate insights for stakeholders. Here are some examples of how data professionals use AI in specific sectors:

### Finance

- Analyze financial transactions to help prevent fraud and protect customers' money.
    
- Analyze large datasets of financial data to help identify potential risks and make more informed decisions about investments.
    
- Analyze historical market data and current market conditions to help generate sound investment recommendations. 
    

### Retail

- Recommend products to customers based on their past purchase history and browsing behavior. 
    
- Track customers' interactions with the retail website to help personalize the shopping experience. 
    
- Analyze sales data and forecast future demand to help optimize the amount of product inventory and reduce costs. 
    

### Manufacturing  

- Automate tasks such as welding, painting, and assembly to help improve efficiency.
    
- Analyze data from sensors and cameras to help identify defects in products before they are shipped to customers. 
    
- Analyze data from production lines to help identify ways to produce more products at a lower cost.
    

## AI and human data professionals 

Data professionals use AI as a tool to help them understand data, make better decisions, and improve efficiency. Like all tools, AI has limitations. Human data professionals possess skills, abilities, and qualities that AI currently lacks. For example: 

- _Intuition_. AI models are trained on data, and they can only make decisions based on the patterns they observe in the data. Humans can use their intuition and personal experience to make decisions that are not explicitly programmed into the AI model. For this reason, it’s important to always verify a model’s output before relying on it.
    
- _Deal with ambiguity._ AI models are good at solving problems that are well-defined and have clear parameters. However, humans can identify and understand complex problems that are not well-defined and have ambiguous parameters by considering key details offered in the context of the project.
    
- _Interpersonal communication_. AI models can generate reports and presentations, but they cannot communicate with stakeholders in the nuanced way that humans can. Humans can explain the results of their analysis to fit the needs of specific stakeholders, and use their emotional intelligence to address concerns. 
    
- _Creativity_. AI models are good at following instructions, but they are not imaginative like humans. Humans can be creative in their approach to data analysis, and imagine new and innovative solutions to complex problems.
    
- _Critical thinking_. Humans can think critically about their data and identify potential biases and ethical issues. AI models are usually trained on real-world data that contains biases and are therefore likely to reflect those biases in model outputs. 
    
- _Leadership_. Humans can be leaders, and they can motivate and inspire others. AI may have difficulty understanding the nuances of human emotion, motivation, and communication. This limits AI’s ability to effectively run an organization.
    
- _Factuality._ Generative AI models are trained to output text based on patterns in language. Sometimes the model output may be very well-composed and as a result, seem reliable, but may not be factual. As noted above, it’s important to always verify model output.
    

In the future, product and research teams may develop updates for AI that enlarge its current capabilities. However, human data professionals will continue to play an important role in data science by using their intuition, imagination, and unique experience to solve complex problems. 

## Key takeaways

Data professionals can use AI to help automate tasks, make predictions, generate insights, and communicate findings. They can leverage AI to be more productive in their work and more impactful in their organizations. Overall, AI is a powerful tool for data professionals but it is not without limitations. For this reason, human oversight and intervention is critical when working with AI and related tools.

# The places you’ll go… 

By now you’re familiar with many of the tools data professionals use to overcome different challenges in their work. However, as important as these technical skills are for your professional development, creating engaging presentations of your work is just as important. As you complete this certificate program, you’ll create a portfolio of projects that you can showcase to employers, other learners, or to broader audiences. In this reading you’ll find examples of the many ways other data professionals in the field have shared their work, so that you can learn what such presentations entail, get a sense of what appeals to you, and perhaps even inspire you in your own journey.

## **Tableau dashboards**

Bill Yost is a data analyst. One way he leverages his data professional skills is by building interactive data visualization dashboards on Tableau. His [project on office supply store analytics](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bill.yost/viz/SuperstoreELVTR/SuperstoreDashboard) is a great example of the dynamic capabilities Tableau offers data professionals. 

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/423a8e76-97b2-4791-bc70-d2dbca5a7e4d)

His  dashboard incorporates several different types of interactive graphs, including a bar chart, a line chart, and a map. You’ll learn how to create these in this certificate program.

Tableau also allows you to create a profile to showcase your work. You can also follow other users and add projects that interest you to a list of favorites. 

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/871dcf58-e6c7-4f94-bca4-b293982d261d)

Tableau is a great platform if you want to feature polished visualizations and demonstrate your ability to communicate results in an engaging and elegant way. 

## **Notebooks on Kaggle**

If you prefer to compose a more technical exposition of your work, Kaggle is a great place to do it. For example, consider [Jesse Mostipak’s profile](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak). Jesse is a data professional who uses Kaggle to contribute coding exemplars and datasets, participate in modeling competitions, and converse with others in the data community. 

The following is an example of a notebook she submitted as a tutorial on using XGBoost in tidymodels, which is a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning. You’ll learn how to use XGBoost with Python later in this certificate program.

In addition to supporting your public presence as a data practitioner, publishing your work this way is a great opportunity to generate discussion of different approaches and methodologies with peers in the data community and to learn new skills. 

## **GitHub repositories**

Another way to feature your work is by using GitHub. GitHub is probably best known for being a version control system used by coders and developers worldwide to keep track of projects involving large codebases with many simultaneous contributors. GitHub also offers tools to create and customize user profiles and project repositories. Take [Ravin Kumar’s GitHub page](https://github.com/canyon289) for example.

Some advantages of GitHub include the ability to structure your projects into repositories, which are like folders that are accessible to other people via Git. Repositories can include Jupyter notebooks, computer programs, images and figures, and markdown exposition. You’ll work extensively with Jupyter notebooks and markdown text throughout this certificate program. GitHub also lets you watch, star, and follow users or individual projects. The platform is particularly useful for sharing code directly with other people and even working collaboratively with them on projects. 

## **Blogs on Medium**

Jupyter notebooks and coding exhibitions aren’t the only means by which you can demonstrate expertise. Blog posts are another great way to propel your professional development. One of the advantages of blogs is that they showcase a wide range of highly sought-after skills beyond just technical proficiency. For example, not only will a well-written blog post convey your understanding of data concepts, tools, and techniques, but it will also emphasize your critical thinking, communication, and writing skills. These types of skills are what distinguish the best data professionals in the field. 

Medium is a great platform to post data science-related blogs. You can also submit to publishers of curated data science content, such as Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, and KDNuggets. As an example, consider the following [article written by Cassie Kozykov](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-work-with-someone-elses-data-f33485d79ed4) (the instructor of this course) that was published on Towards Data Science.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/a3130128-68f8-48ce-a549-7af70cdb3361)

This post isn’t about coding or complex computer science or mathematics at all! It’s a practical guide for avoiding pitfalls when working with third-party data. Such topics are highly relevant, and writing about them is another great way to access exciting career opportunities.

## **Other approaches**

This list isn’t exhaustive. It’s intended to give you an idea of the possibilities for presenting your work and becoming an active participant in the field. Some people share Jupyter notebooks, others write helpful articles, and others create podcasts or YouTube videos. For example, consider [this YouTube video on bias in machine learning and AI, produced by Angelica Spratley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2gTrr0SKuI), a data scientist and educator. 

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/326d0253-d57e-4022-afb5-b7b51b8bc55a)

By the way, bias is something you’ll learn about in the course on machine learning. Find what excites you, and your enthusiasm will be evident. The possibilities are vast if you follow your imagination and motivation to contribute to the exciting world of data.

## **Key Takeaways**

These are just a few ways you can share your work. One of the great things about doing so is that it gives you a public-facing profile that employers can review. If someone searches for your name and finds an impressive portfolio, it gives you more opportunity to stand out. Additionally, presenting your work forces you to clearly explain (and thus understand) your methodologies, making you a stronger data practitioner. Whichever way you choose to share your work, be creative, have fun, and don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. This is your opportunity to impress!

# Make the most out of mentorships

As you have been learning, professional relationships can help you find job opportunities. Exploring job boards and online resources is only one part of your job search process; it is just as important to connect with other professionals in your field, build your network, and interact with the data science community. A great way to achieve these goals is by building a relationship with a mentor. In this reading, you will learn more about mentors, the benefits of mentorship, and how to connect with potential mentors. 

## Considering mentorship

Mentors are professionals who share knowledge, skills, and experiences to help you grow and develop. They can offer guidance at different points in your career. Mentors can be advisors, sounding boards, honest critics, resources, and more. You can even have multiple mentors to gain more diverse perspectives! 

There are a few things to consider along the way:

- **Decide what you are searching for in a mentor.** Think about your strengths and weaknesses, what challenges you have encountered, and how you would like to grow as a data professional. Share these ideas with potential mentors who might have had similar experiences and have guidance to share.
    
- **Consider common interests.** Often you can find great mentorships with people who share interests and backgrounds with you. This could include someone who had a similar career path or even someone from your hometown. 
    
- **Respect their time**. Often, mentors are busy! Make sure the person you are asking to mentor you has time to support your growth. It’s also important for you to put in the effort necessary to maintain the relationship and stay connected with them.
    

Note that mentors don't have to be directly related to data science. Mentors can be friends of friends, more experienced coworkers, former colleagues, or even teammates. For example, if you find a family friend who has a lot of experience in their own non-data field, but shares a similar background as you and understands what you're trying to achieve, that person may become an invaluable mentor to you. Or, you might happen to meet someone at a casual work outing or a professional conference or meetup with whom you develop an instant connection over shared interests or hobbies. 

No one mentor may be able (or willing) to advise in all areas, so think about the skills, insights, or values you appreciate in that individual. Then, build a network of individuals that you may approach with different questions about different topics (job searches, public speaking, technical topics, different industries, etc.).

## Build the relationship

Once you have considered what you’re looking for in a mentor and found someone with time and experience to share, you’ll need to build that relationship. Sometimes, the connection happens naturally, but usually, you need to formally ask them to mentor you. 

One great way to reach out is with a friendly email or a message on a professional networking website. Describe your career goals, explain how you think those goals align with their own experiences, and talk about something you admire about them professionally. Then you can suggest a coffee chat, virtual meetup, or email exchange as a first step.

Be sure to check in with yourself. It’s important that you feel like it is a natural fit and that you’re getting the mentorship you need. Mentor-mentee relationships are equal partnerships, so the more honest you are with them, the more they can help you. Most importantly, remember to thank them for their time and effort!

As you get in touch with potential mentors, you might feel nervous about being a bother or taking up too much of their time. But, mentorship is meaningful for mentors too. They often genuinely want to help you succeed and are invested in your growth. Your success brings them joy! Many mentors enjoy recounting their experiences and sharing their successes with you as well. Mentors often learn a lot from their mentees. Both sides of the mentoring relationship are meaningful!

## Resources

There are a lot of great resources you can use to help you connect with potential mentors. Here are just a few:

- **Meetups** are meetings that are usually local to your geography. Enter a search for “data science meetups near me” to check out what results you get. There is usually a posted schedule for upcoming meetings. Find out more information about [meetups happening around the world](https://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=data%20science&source=EVENTS). 
    
- **Platforms** including LinkedIn® and Twitter are a great way to reach out to other professionals. Use a search on either platform to find data science or data analysis hashtags to follow. Post your own questions or articles to generate responses and build connections that way. 
    
- **Webinars** may showcase a panel of speakers and are usually recorded for convenient access and playback. You can see who is on a webinar panel and follow them too. Plus, a lot of webinars are free. One interesting pick is the [Tableau on Tableau webinar series](https://www.tableau.com/learn/series/how-we-do-data). Find out how Tableau has used Tableau in its internal departments. There are also a number of other data science related webinars available at [Brighttalk.com](https://www.brighttalk.com/topic/data-science/)
    
- **Conferences** present innovative ideas and topics. The cost varies, and some are expensive. But, many offer discounts to students, and some conferences like [Women in Analytics](https://womeninanalytics.com/about/) aim to increase the number of under-represented groups in the field. 
    
- **Associations** or **societies** gather members to promote a field such as data analytics. Many memberships are free. The [Association of Data Scientists](https://www.adasci.org/) is just one example. The [Cape Fear Community College Library](https://libguides.cfcc.edu/c.php?g=604688&p=4191138) also has a list of professional associations for analytics, business intelligence, and business analysis.
    
- **User communities** and **summits** offer events for users of professional tools; this is a chance to learn from the best. Have you explored the [Tableau](https://community.tableau.com/s/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/community/) communities?
    
- **Non-profit organizations** that promote the ethical use of data science often offer events for the professional advancement of their members. The [Data Science Association](https://www.datascienceassn.org/) is one example. 
    

## Key takeaways

Finding and connecting with a mentor is a great way to build your network, access career opportunities, and learn from someone who has already experienced some of the challenges you’re facing in your career. Whether your mentor is a senior coworker, someone you connect with on LinkedIn®, or someone from home on a similar career path, mentorship can bring you great benefits as a data analytics professional.

# Showcase your skills: How to prepare for the interview

As you’ve been learning, there are many steps that go into preparing for your job search in the data career space. Before you even start applying for jobs, it’s important that you take two key steps. You need to build a professional online presence and develop your portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers. This is also a great time to connect with mentors, who can provide professional insight and help you prepare for the application process. The interview will often be the final step in this process; in addition to all of the other job prep you’ll do, preparing for the interview will help you approach this last step confidently. To help get you ready for the job market, this reading will explore four different interview types and offer interview questions that this certificate program will help you answer. 

## Establishing your professional narrative

Establishing a professional narrative, or brand, can help you build connections between your daily work and the positive influence it has on something bigger. This something bigger could be an exciting project that you helped finish or a positive change in your organization or community! This applies to the work you have done previously and the work you hope to do in the roles you apply for. Framing your experience and goals around your professional narrative allows you to develop a stronger sense of the value you bring to an organization and your own career goals. Keeping your professional narrative top of mind is important as you prepare to enter or navigate the data professional career space. Your personal brand is the value you offer potential employers. It can often provide answers to questions posed during the interview process. 

## Interview question types 

There are many different types of interview questions and each organization has its own priorities for what they want to know about each applicant for each role. Interview questions typically belong to one of four categories:  

- **Behavioral questions**: These questions ask you to describe how you have handled specific situations in the past, and your personal characteristics. They are designed to assess your skills, experience, and problem-solving abilities, as well as your fit for the company culture.
    
- **Technical questions**: These questions ask you to demonstrate the knowledge and skills presented in your resume or portfolio. In job interviews for technical positions, an employer may ask for a demonstration of specific tasks, prior projects, or even a take-home assessment. Often these technical demonstrations are presented as a separate assignment that you will complete outside of the interview itself. These questions are designed to assess your technical skills and expertise.
    
- **Situational questions**: These questions ask you how you would handle hypothetical situations. Similar to behavioral questions, employers typically use situational questions to develop a preliminary understanding of how your skills fit the role. Situational questions are designed to assess your judgment, critical thinking skills, and ability to apply knowledge to new situations.
    
- **Subject questions**: These questions ask you about your knowledge of a specific subject or area, usually pertaining to the field or industry that you’re applying for. These questions are designed to determine how well you understand the relationship between the role you’re applying for and the broader context of the company. Employers may also use these questions to assess your understanding of how the company works in contrast to direct competitors in the marketplace. 
    

These are just a few examples of the types of questions you might be asked in interviews. These categories aren’t universal, and different organizations have different interview styles– they may even ask questions that combine categories. For example, an interviewer might give you a hypothetical situation and ask you for an example of a previous situation you’ve encountered that relates. This is a combination of a behavioral and situational question. Generally, the goal of interview questions is to assess your skills, experience, and general fit for the role; so keep that in mind as you prepare.

## Applying course skills

# Module 4 Data applications and workflow

# The PACE Stages

So far, you have been introduced to the PACE framework and learned how it provides a clear foundation and structure for data analysis projects. You also learned that PACE is an acronym; each one of the letters represents an actionable stage in a project: plan, analyze, construct, and execute. In this reading, you will learn more about the PACE workflow and discover how each stage of the process can help guide data analysis.

## Why do we use a workflow structure?

As a general rule, data professionals rely on workflow structures to guide them through the duration of data projects. Within a large-scale project, there can be a number of tasks that require a certain order of operations. Identifying complexities and finding consistent ways to work together can make projects more efficient and enable more productive communication. Identifying these and other types of potential blockers early can help you plan and prepare resources in advance before they can negatively affect a project. 

Our team of data professionals who assisted in creating this program developed PACE as a flexible model; you are encouraged to revisit each stage without interrupting the entire workflow. Through PACE, you will identify areas of action and contexts for when they will need to be considered. All in all, PACE offers professionals a customizable scaffold that can support their efforts while working through every stage of a data project.

## A closer look at the PACE model

Let’s take a closer look at each stage of the PACE model.

![image](https://github.com/kemda2/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics/assets/19648132/8f1863c1-278c-400d-91ce-5f3de88fe456)

### **Plan** 

At the beginning of a project, it is important to establish a solid foundation for success. Here you will define the scope of your project. This is when you will begin by identifying the informational needs of the organization. During the planning stage, you will have the widest viewpoint of a project. By assessing all of the factors and processes involved, you are mapping a path to completion, using your creativity to conceptualize a course of action. Here you will also take special note of tasks that may require an innovative approach within your workflow.

**Summary**: The planning stage is where you conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.

Here are a few examples of the types of planning stage tasks:

- Research business data
    
- Define the project scope
    
- Develop a workflow
    
- Assess project and/or stakeholder needs
    

### **Analyze**

In the analyzing stage, you will interact with the data for the first time. Here you will acquire all of the data you will need for the project. Some datasets could come from primary sources within your organization. Others may need to be collected from secondary sources outside your company. You may even find that you need governmental or open source data. The analyzing stage is also where you will engage in exploratory data analysis or EDA. This involves cleaning, reorganizing and analyzing all of the necessary data for the project.

**Summary**: The analyzing stage is where you will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.

Here are a few examples of the types of analyzing stage tasks:

- Format database
    
- Scrub data
    
- Convert data into usable formats
    

### **Construct**

Just as the name suggests, the construction stage is all about building. In this stage of PACE, you will be building, interpreting, and revising models. Some projects will require machine learning algorithms to uncover correlations within your data. You will use these correlations to uncover information from the data that would otherwise go unused. These relationships can help your organization make informed decisions about the future.

**Summary**: In the construction stage you will build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data.

Here are a few examples of the types of construction stage tasks:

- Select modeling approach
    
- Build models
    
- Build machine learning algorithms
    

### **Execute**

In the execution stage, you will put your analysis and construction into action. Here you will deliver your findings to the internal (inside of your organization) and external (outside of your organization) stakeholders. Quite often, this will involve stakeholders from the business-side of the companies you are working with. Presenting your findings is only a part of the execution stage. Stakeholders will provide feedback, ask questions, and make recommendations that you will collect and incorporate.

**Summary**: In the execution stage you will present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

Here are a few examples of execution stage tasks:

- Share results
    
- Present findings to other stakeholders
    
- Address feedback
    

## Communication and PACE 

Regardless of where you might be within the PACE workflow, communication is essential to moving the framework through to the realization of the project. One way to think of this is by visualizing the four stages of PACE as a completed circuit and with communication being represented by the flow of electricity. 

At each stage, there will always be a need for communication to improve the workflow. This could be asking questions about your data, gathering additional sources, updating stakeholders on progress, or presenting findings and receiving feedback. 

## Adaptability of PACE

At the start of a project, the PACE model offers a good structure to guide you. At the beginning, you have the planning stage, where you gather the information and tools you will need and set up a framework to guide you. When you are analyzing data and constructing models, the analyzing and construction stages assist you. After these steps, the execution stage is where you share results and gather feedback.

Although the PACE model is first presented as stages in a certain order, you will discover that the open flow of communication allows you to easily move to the stages you need. New information and feedback can be incorporated at any part of the process. You might need to return to the analyzing stage to clarify some aspect of the data and then go to the executing stage to present this aspect to your stakeholders, without the need to construct new models. The PACE framework can be adapted to fit any project. Its adaptability will prepare you for a dynamic profession that requires a high degree of professional flexibility and communication.

## Key takeaways 

Data professionals need structured workflows to help them manage the large number of tasks within data projects. The PACE professional workflow was designed specifically for this program to assist you in developing your professional structures and practices. PACE functions like a completed circuit, with communication flowing between each stage. The design of PACE promotes flexibility, allowing for free movement between stages as needed.

# Best communication practices for data professionals

# Effective communication drives PACE 

Throughout the stages of PACE, stakeholders can offer feedback, pose questions, or ask for clarification. Being able to communicate is key; at every point in a project’s life cycle, you will need to be able to share obstacles and results, and provide necessary information to guide decision-making. Communication drives each stage of PACE, from collecting data to constructing models to sharing results. As a data professional, you will need a combination of strong communication skills and the technical skills you’re learning to succeed in the data career space. In this reading, you will learn some tips for effective communication you can apply throughout the stages of PACE. You will also discover some best practices for sharing your findings through presentations that you can use in the future.

# Seven tips for effective communication

Over the course of a typical work day, you will interact with stakeholders in a variety of ways. Some of your interactions will be through emails and messaging, others through meetings and one-on-one conversations, and even formal presentations. Each interaction requires an individualized approach to ensure that your audience understands what you are trying to communicate. The following seven tips can help guide your communication, no matter what form it takes or what stage of PACE your project is in: 

### 1. Speak the language of your audience

Identify the needs of your audience. It’s important to know the objectives of the person you are communicating with. Focusing on their needs allows you to gain insight and assess how technical the conversation should be. Consider the following questions:

- Why has this person contacted you?
    
- What does your stakeholder want from this interaction?
    
- What’s important to them, their team, or their organization?
    

In your role as a data professional, you will interact with a variety of stakeholders. Determine what they know, what they need to know, and what might go beyond their level of involvement in a project. 

- Break down technical concepts into simpler terms. 
    
- Use shorter sentences so main ideas are easier to understand and remember.
    
- Use direct language and minimize embellishments or unnecessary detail.
    
- Pay attention to diverse backgrounds and respect the lived experiences of others.
    

**Pro tip**: Avoid jargon, acronyms, and technical “buzzwords” that could lead to confusion.

### 2. Invite questions and welcome feedback

Everyone can use feedback–whether it is positive reinforcement or areas for improvement. When you are focused on the details of a task, it’s possible to overlook something. Another person’s feedback offers you a great way to gather insights for your personal growth and professional excellence. By accepting the challenge that feedback and questions present, you will strengthen your own skills and help the overall project.

- Merge your passion for finding solutions with the goals of the project.
    
- Continue to strive for greater understanding of the results.
    
- Elicit feedback and questions to improve communication about your projects.
    
- Consider opportunities to reflect on your communication skills.
    

**Pro tip**: Analyze feedback. Is it valid? Does the person have a complete understanding of the goals of the project or data analytical process? If not, set up an additional meeting to help clarify.

### 3. Be the connection to the data

You are your team’s direct connection to the insights your data offers. Your goal is to help other stakeholders understand the process and how it addresses their needs. When everyone understands the process, communication can be highly effective.

- Focus on the objectives to help others better understand your data process.
    
- Tell the story of the data with a compelling and cohesive narrative.
    
- Respond to questions in a timely manner.
    
- Demonstrate your value to the team. 
    
- Find opportunities to address stakeholder questions.
    

**Pro tip**: Continue to proactively identify ways the data and tools you have access to can address the objectives of your team and drive new insights.

### 4. Let your visualizations help tell the story 

Visualizations are one of the best ways to communicate ideas, especially when dealing with big data. Visual references help bring to life the details inside your data. Graphs, charts, and infographics can promote general understanding. Later you will explore Tableau, a visualization tool that you can use to create compelling visuals from data.

- Be sure that your visuals tell the story within the data.
    
- Design visualizations for inclusivity.
    
- Use labels and text to clarify, not clutter. 
    
- Use fonts that are easy to read.
    
- Use high contrast, shading, and other customizations to communicate your messages clearly.
    
- Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats.
    

**Pro tip**: Keep visualizations simple. When deciding what to include in a presentation, less is more.

### 5. Build positive professional relationships

When you consider the responsibilities and objectives of others, your communication will reflect that consideration. This builds credibility and influence in your workplace and allows you to continue growing throughout your career. 

- Focus on what matters to your audience.
    
- Invite feedback and discussion.
    
- Be a trusted subject matter expert who communicates clearly and inclusively.
    
- Cultivate positive interactions to strengthen working relationships and improve morale.
    

**Pro tip**: When a stakeholder contacts you, be accessible and engaged in your communication.

### 6. Identify assumptions about the data

The backgrounds, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews of people can influence the information contained within data. In your role as a data analytics professional, you will want to consider ways that these various factors can introduce bias.

If they are not recognized, assumptions can have a powerful effect on outcomes. Without information, there is often a tendency to fill in the gaps in understanding with assumptions. The most effective methods to reduce the impact of assumptions are practicing active listening and effectively asking questions. For example, these questions can help identify any assumptions:

- Is there something I am taking for granted?
    
- Am I assuming something here that I shouldn’t?
    
- Can I determine if the assumption is correct?
    

**Pro tip:** Data professionals need to identify their own assumptions as well as any assumptions their audience might have. Make sure you consider any bias you might have, too!

### 7. Identify limitations in the data 

As a data professional, you will also encounter limitations within data that can impede your analysis. These limitations will need to be addressed before you can proceed. To assist you in identifying data limitations, ask the following questions:

- Is the data complete? Are there missing values or sections?
    
- Are the datasets formatted correctly?
    
- Is this a sufficient sample size to conduct analysis of an entire population or group?
    
- What are the biases present in the data set?
    
- Does this data contain personally identifiable information? What steps will I take to protect this information?
    

**Pro tip:** In addition to identifying and communicating about data limitations before analysis, you will also need to make sure stakeholders are aware of any limitations still affecting the results during your presentation.

## Share Findings

One of the most important communications you will have with stakeholders will be sharing your findings, often through presentations. This will mean translating the results, concepts, and terms of your analysis for wider audiences. When sharing the results of your analysis with stakeholders, there are some best practices that you should apply:

- Craft results to the needs of your stakeholders. Communicate why this data will help them achieve their goals.
    
- Determine the visualizations and/or dashboards that are the most effective. What data will you need to show and how do you want stakeholders to interact with it?
    
- Think about the design carefully. A simple yet visually appealing approach to visualizations is always the best.
    
- Use a hierarchy of data in your visualizations/dashboards. Information that is most important should be easily accessible, but you should provide a path for more details.
    

### What should I keep in mind when I share results?

- What information is the most important to my audience?
    
- What is the most efficient way to share with the tools available and the time I’m allotted?
    
- What can I do to make the key points effectively?
    

### Presentations

Presenting information clearly and effectively is key to a data scientist's workflow. Communication skills that pertain to presentations include but are not limited to: the structure of your presentation, slide design, the tone of your voice and the body language you convey, and more. It’s also important to consider accessibility as you are creating any assets. Check with your organization about accessibility guidelines. You may also refer to online resources like [U.S. accessibility guidelines](https://accessibility.digital.gov/) or [The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) web accessibility initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).

#### Tips for presentations

- Structure your presentation. Be sure there is a logical structure: a beginning, middle, and end.
    
- Presentation slides are not scripts. Don’t read or put complete paragraphs on presentation slides.
    
- Make sure your data can be understood visually and consider potential accessibility challenges for your audience.
    
- Focus most on the points your data illustrates.
    
- Share one—and only one—major point from each chart.
    
- Label chart components clearly.
    
- Visually highlight “Aha!” zones.
    
- Write a slide title that reinforces the data’s point.
    

A solid presentation can help others understand the findings of your data analysis and ensure that you are effectively communicating.

## Key takeaways

Effective communication is important for data professionals. Regardless of where you are in the framework of a project, communication can inform and empower your stakeholders. Identify the needs of your audience and invite feedback. Remember that your role is to connect the data, technology, and the stakeholders. When sharing the results of your data analysis, make your presentations clear, focused, accessible, and take into account any assumptions or limitations presented by the data. Demonstrate your value by being available and ready to share insights in a simple way that promotes general understanding.

# Elements of successful communication

As you have been learning, communication is the driving force behind PACE because data professionals need to be able to communicate effectively with stakeholders while working through different stages of a project. You have already learned some important tips for effective communication. But, there are a few more elements for successful communication you should consider. This reading provides best practices for successful communication that you can follow in your workplace communications. 

## Understanding why

Having a clear vision of why you are communicating is the first thing you need to consider. Your “why” depends on the context set by the business or organization you work for as well as the goals orienting the project. When crafting any form of communication, use your why to guide main ideas so that your audience can identify how to act or respond with purpose.  

When you prepare to communicate, take a moment to outline important goals and expectations you have, like: 

- Goals of the project you are communicating about
    
- What you hope to gain from this communication
    
- What you’re asking your audience to do
    
- What you need your audience to understand
    

Understanding the why behind your communication will help you organize your thoughts and develop clearer, more direct communication. 

## Set the stage

When you are developing effective communication, you have to consider more than just the why–you also need to think about _where_ the communication is taking place. Setting will have a direct impact on how your message is delivered and how you shape it. As you prepare to communicate, consider the most appropriate way to communicate for the setting you plan to be in.

On the job, it’s possible that you will communicate in a variety of settings. What information you share, how you share it, and how you follow up will depend on the context of that communication. For example, you might:

- Ask a coworker for advice about a recent obstacle over lunch
    
- Send an email updating all the stakeholders about an important project
    
- Share progress with your team in a weekly meeting
    
- Present the results of your analysis to a boardroom of executives
    

Each of these settings will require you to consider how you’re communicating, what each of those audiences need, and what you need from them in return. As you develop your communication skills, don’t forget that the setting can be just as important as the actual communication.  

### How to work one-on-one and in small groups

One of the most common settings you will work in as a data professional is a one-on-one or small group meeting. As you prepare to communicate in these settings, remember that it is important to:

- Respect your colleagues' time by scheduling a meeting in advance 
    
- Convey interest by practicing active listening
    
- Check for alignment by asking questions
    

## All about time

Time is a currency in the professional world. It’s very important to be efficient–this includes making sure your communication is understandable so that stakeholders can quickly comprehend your message. To ensure your message is clear and concise, remember to always:

- Use direct language 
    
- Minimize wordiness
    
- Avoid unnecessary details
    
- Always strive for clarity  
    
- Use proper grammar and punctuation
    
- Keep vocabulary simple and avoid technical language
    
- Break complex ideas into shorter sentences to make concepts easier to understand and remember
    

Not only will these suggestions help make your communication efficient and easier to understand, they will also save you time having to re-explain important concepts. And more than that, your colleagues will be grateful that you respected their time. 

## Active Listening

As you begin your career as a data professional, you will spend a lot of time in meetings and in conversation. Many stakeholders are from different departments both inside and outside of your organization. The information shared during these interactions is valuable. Often, it’s where you gather insight into how the business operates, its goals, key milestones, and parameters within projects. 

When you listen actively, you:

- Invite understanding of others
    
- Develop empathy for others and their responsibilities 
    
- Build a connection with colleagues
    
- Promote trust
    

When you are practicing active listening, you make the effort to understand the speaker’s point of view. This helps you understand what other people are trying to communicate and sets you up to ask better, more insightful questions.

## Asking Questions 

Data professionals aren’t automatically developing solutions. For data analysis to be effective, data professionals need to ask the right questions. In fact, the entire data analytical process depends on it. 

Asking questions is a powerful communication tool. Asking the right questions can lead to institutional learning and a fruitful exchange of ideas. Many times, questions invite innovation and initiate efforts that can help improve projects and overall workflow. 

Asking questions builds rapport and trust among team members. The right questions can often help mitigate business risks by uncovering unforeseen pitfalls and hazards. Here are a few tips to help guide your questioning:

- Ask questions that haven’t been answered already
    
- Ask questions that reveal the bigger picture
    
- Ask questions that gather information or further the knowledge of the team
    
- Ask questions that can help clarify misunderstandings
    

Effective questions are more likely to get you the answers you need to do your best work– which is good for the whole team. 

## Key takeaways

In this reading, you learned that communication is present in all aspects of data professional work. Focus on the purpose, setting, and timing of your communication in order to promote more successful discussions with your team. Additionally, becoming an active listener that asks relevant questions enables more efficient communication and invites the perspective of other stakeholders. All these factors add up and make a big difference in how effectively you communicate as a data professional.

# Communicate objectives with a project proposal

In this reading you will continue examining communication within the data workspace. As you have learned, communication is a key part of all aspects of data professional work. On a data team, project tasks and responsibilities are shared by different data professionals. Effective communication and collaboration among all team members and stakeholders is key to the success of any data project.

A **project proposal** can provide the structure and communication needed for tracking tasks. In addition, project proposals are beneficial for teams when facing challenges that require a high degree of flexibility. As projects progress, the expectations, resources, or even team members can change. This will require adjustments within a project that can impact the overall workflow and delivery date.

## Project proposals

A project proposal's main function is to outline objectives and requirements. Project proposals present ideas in more detailed and actionable segments often called **milestones**. Proposals are commonly created with input from team members and other stakeholders. It may also be the case that project proposals are shared with clients or executives to gain approval and inform them of a project’s path to completion. Project proposals are used across a multitude of industries and organizations. Although the design and layout of project proposals can vary, there are key elements that are common among them.

### Elements of a project proposal

Each project proposal contains important information that a team will need to consider before work begins. Below is a brief explanation of some common sections you will find in project proposals. Note that the format of project proposals will vary, so not every section described here will be included in every project proposal.

**Project title:** The title of the project is prominent, usually placed near the top of a document. Effective titles are brief and purposeful. Depending on the context and circumstances surrounding a project, the title can change over time.

**Project objective:** The objective statement is a one to three sentence explanation of what the project is trying to achieve.

**Milestones:** Milestones are groupings of tasks within a project, breaking the work needed into smaller, manageable goals. Milestones assist in the delegation and scheduling of work that needs to be completed within projects.

- The milestones in the provided example are representative of future end-of-course projects.
    

**Tasks:** Tasks detail the work that needs to be completed within a milestone.

- The tasks in the provided example parallel some of the work you will complete in upcoming end-of-course projects.
    

**Outcomes:** Outcomes are the completed actions or results that allow a project to continue.

**Deliverables:** Deliverables are items that can be shared amongst team members or with stakeholders. These are the end products of work undertaken for a project.

**Stakeholders:** The individuals or groups who are directly involved and have a vested interest in the success of a project. Input from stakeholders can serve as a basis for making decisions throughout a project.

**Estimated time:** At the beginning of a project, the time needed to complete milestones is estimated. As a project develops, these estimates will often need to be updated to account for adjustments to timelines or changes in team members.

### Sample project proposal

The sample project proposal, linked below, deals with a fictional visitation prediction project undertaken by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). Use this document as a reference as you review each of the following sections.

This project proposal’s audience is the NPS data team. The purpose is to gather a comprehensive list of project tasks and divide them into smaller actionable groupings or milestones. Project proposals assist project managers in setting up task tracking, scheduling, and allocating resources. Furthermore, they serve as a reference for the team and as a valuable tool when new members are added to the project.

## PACE and project proposals

In this course, you learned about the scalability of PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute). Through the PACE framework, projects can be organized globally by outlining their main tasks and deliverables. At the same time, each individual task within a project can be broken down into smaller actions.

You will discover that PACE strategy documents are a great reference when working on project proposals. During your end-of-course projects, you’ll be presented with questions that will assist you in identifying the planning, analyzing, constructing, and executing stages. The more time you spend considering and answering each question, the more information you’ll have available to you when creating project proposals.

## Key takeaways

A project proposal is a plan of action that outlines what needs to be accomplished and how to achieve your intended goals and outcomes. Proposals define a project’s purpose and scope, and list key milestones, deliverables, timelines, and schedules. It’s important to update proposals throughout the course of a project, as the project’s scope, objectives, and stakeholders may change over time.

# Connect PACE with executive summaries

In this reading, you will continue to examine communication within the data professional workplace. Regardless of workflow, data professionals need ways to share and communicate plans, updates, and summaries about projects. A document called an **executive summary** is used to update decision makers who may not be directly involved in the tasks of a project. In your role as a data professional, you will often be involved in creating executive summaries. 

## Executive summaries

Executive summaries are documents that summarize the most important points about a project, giving decision makers a brief overview of the most relevant information. They can also be used to help new team members quickly become acquainted with a project. The format is designed to respect the responsibilities of decision makers and/or executives who may not have time to read and understand an entire report. 

Executive summaries are used across numerous industries and organizations. There are many ways to present information within an executive summary, including software options built specifically for that purpose. In this program, you will primarily consider a one-page format within a presentation slide. Although the design and layout of executive summaries can vary, there are key elements that are common among them.

### Elements of an executive summary

Executive summaries are used across a wide variety of businesses and typically include the following elements: 

**Project title:** A project's theme is incorporated into the executive summary title to create an immediate connection with the target audience.

**The problem:** A statement that focuses on the need or concern being targeted or addressed by the project. Note that the problem can also be referred to as the hypothesis that you’re trying to prove through data analysis.

**The solution:** This statement summarizes a project’s main goal. In this section, actions are described that address the concerns outlined in the problem statement.

**Details/Key Insights:** The purpose of this section is to provide any additional background information that may assist the target audience in understanding the project's objectives. Determining what details to include depends on the intended audience.

**Next steps/Recommendations:** Information that supports the actions the team plans to take. This can also include recommendations for decision makers based on the insights gained over the course of the project. In this section, a data professional may also include general project reflections. When you are adding to this section, include at least one point for recommendations and one for the suggested next steps.

### Sample executive summary

The following linked sample executive summary deals with a fictional visitation prediction project undertaken by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The intended audience of this summary is a group of decision makers from NPS leadership. The purpose of this summary is to share the insights gained through data analysis of recreational park visits. Each section delivers a short statement without embellishment. This allows decision makers to quickly grasp the most relevant points about a project. Reference this document as you review each of the following sections.

## PACE and executive summaries

In this course, you explored the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) workflow and how it can help guide projects. Through PACE, the tasks and deliverables of a project are clearly identified and recorded in a PACE strategy document. 

You will discover that PACE strategy documents are a great reference when working on executive summaries. When planning, analyzing, constructing, and executing your end-of-course and capstone projects, the PACE strategy documents provide questions to guide you. The more time you spend considering and answering each question, the more information you’ll have available to you when creating executive summaries.

## Key takeaways

Executive summaries offer an effective way to share information with decision makers, clients, and executives. These documents summarize the most important information within a project or plan of action, and share key insights and results. Typically, an executive summary reports on an identified problem and outlines the solutions used to address the problem.

# Module 5 Course 1 end-of-course project

# End-of-course portfolio project introduction

Each course in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate concludes with a project that provides hands-on opportunities to practice your knowledge. These end-of-course portfolio projects build across courses to simulate the full lifecycle of a data project, just like job tasks that you will encounter as a data professional. 

After completing all of the courses in this certificate program, you are encouraged to compile the projects in a portfolio that highlights your data analytics skills. You will learn how to create a portfolio in the final course of this certificate program: Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone. In addition, the end-of-course projects can also be used to help you prepare for job applications and interviews since they showcase the valuable skills that you bring to the world of data analytics.

## **Importance of communication in the data career space**

End-of-course projects emphasize technical and professional workplace skills, as well as the importance of communication in data analytics. The success of your workflow management, data analysis, data visualizations, statistics, regression analysis, and building machine learning models relies on your ability to communicate with cross-functional team members. So, each project is designed to help you develop critical communication skills that you’ll need to use on the job in order to effectively: 

- Ask questions
    
- Share project needs
    
- Communicate with stakeholders
    
- Give and receive feedback
    
- Stay in contact with team members on the project
    

**Expectations** 

As previously mentioned, you will encounter an end-of-course project in the final module of each course. The end-of-course projects were designed around a workplace scenario that will guide you through tasks that align with the concepts and skills you learned in each course. The workplace scenario extends across all of the certificate’s end-of-course projects.

You will be given the tools, resources, and instructions needed to apply your new skills and complete each individual end-of-course project. Additionally, you’ll also have access to helpful resources designed to guide and inspire your data analysis workflow. In the end, your effort will be rewarded with work examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of your data analysis. If you get stuck at any point, there are links to review relevant information within each course.

To help you complete each end-of-course project, you will receive a PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute) strategy document to guide your workflow. As you answer the questions, you will gain a deeper understanding of the data analysis process, document your growth as a data professional, and prepare the observations and reflections needed to complete each project.

# **Start your project**

To complete the end-of-course portfolio project, you will first need to:

- Gather information about the business problem or question to be answered.
    
- Respond to key questions posed in the PACE strategy document.
    
- Create a project proposal for cross-functional team members.
    

In the next reading, you will learn about the workplace scenarios and how to get started on your end-of-course project. Good luck!
