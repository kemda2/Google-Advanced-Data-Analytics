# Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate

Hello, and welcome to the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**! The seven courses in this certificate program will advance your knowledge and help you grow in your career as a data analytics professional. A foundational background in data analytics is strongly encouraged.

## Enter a growing field

Why are data analytics skills in such high demand? Companies report the [largest skills gap](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/beyond-hiring-how-companies-are-reskilling-to-address-talent-gaps) in data analytics, and the demand for data analytics skills is growing over [15 times faster](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/digital-skills-labour-market-future/) than the demand for the average skill in the US. As computing power has accelerated, industries have sought to leverage the increasing amount of data available to them. Companies are incorporating data analysis to better understand their customers and improve their products and services. Increasingly, companies are employing data professionals to help guide future business decisions. As a result, data professionals need the ability to better understand the challenges and possibilities of machine learning, build accurate predictive models, and clearly articulate their findings.

Throughout this program, you will explore concepts and scenarios that will help you grow your knowledge and skills as a data professional.
